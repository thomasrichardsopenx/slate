# Introduction

OpenX provides a JSON-based API to communicate with the OpenX Platform and perform create, read, update, delete, and batch operations over HTTP. This allows you to develop and integrate applications. Any tasks that you can perform in the OpenX UI can be automated via calls to the OpenX Platform API.

This guide is intended for developers responsible for integrating their applications with OpenX. You should have a general understanding of OpenX ad serving objects and how they relate to one another, such as accounts, users, sites, ad units, orders, line items, and ads.

For detailed information about each Platform API object or service, see the Platform API reference. You can also query the API directly to get information about available fields for each object and available options. For details, see available fields.
To see what's new in the platform API, see the API Release Notes.

# Getting started

Use the links in this quick overview to get started using the OpenX API.
  * Authenticating users - Describes your options for authenticating a user to the Openx Platform API, with links to more information.
  * API client libraries - Describes the available OpenX client libaries that can help you integrate your application with the OpenX API.
  * Third-party libraries - Provides a list of links to recommended third-party libraries to consider for your OpenX API application integration.
  * Requests and responses - Explains the basic structure of an HTTP request and a JSON response.
  * Response codes and error handling - Describes the types of errors that are returned and what they mean.

# Authenticating users

If you are programmatically accessing the OpenX API, you must provide a method to authenticate a user. The OpenX API uses OAuth 1.0 to authenticate users. The following explains your options.

Your Authentication Options

You can programmatically authenticate an OpenX user in one of three ways:
  * (Recommended) Use the client libraries provided by OpenX.
  * (Recommended) Use a third-party library that already implements an OAuth 1.0 scheme. Note that OpenX does not support or manage the content of these libraries.
  * Write your own authentication code. OpenX provides a brief OAuth reference for those who want to take this approach.

Credentials Supplied by OpenX
When you become an API customer, OpenX provides you with the following credentials which you will use in initial authentication calls.
Credentials Supplied by OpenX

Parameter | Description |
--------- | ----------- | 
username | Your account username provided by your account manager. |
Password | Your account password provided by your account manager. |
Consumer Key | The ID portion of your Consumer credentials, provided by your account manager. |
Consumer Secret | The Consumer secret can be thought of as the password for the Consumer credentials. This is also provided by your account manager. |
OAuth Realm | The realm value is a string, generally assigned by the origin server. In this case, the realm parameter is used for your OpenX server instance. For example, OAuth realm="http://server_name.com" |

# API Client Libraries

The OpenX Platform API provides a number of different API client libraries you can use to start integrating your application with the API. Currently, there are three available client libraries in the OpenX public GitHub repository you can use for application integration with the Platform API:
  * Java
  * PHP
  * Python

##Java Client Library

The Java client library enables you to implement OAuth authentication logic to work with the API so you will not need to implement the authentication logic yourself. This simplifies and speeds up the process of integrating your application with the OpenX Platform API. Within the client library, you will find a README.txt file that describes how you can install, configure and use the Java client library to work with your application, as well as demo authentication files (e.g. test.java/com/openx/oauthdemo) and a default.properties file you can use in your implementation.

To use the Java client library, navigate to the OpenX public GitHub location for the client libary and review the included README.txt file, which explains how to install and configure your OpenX instance, build the JAR file, and then use the Java package to integrate your application with the OpenX Platform API.

In the client library, you will also see a number of example scripts and demo files in the src folder that you can use in your implementation of the OpenX Platform API.

## PHP Client Library

The PHP client library provides a client class with examples you can use to integrate your application with the OpenX Platform API. Included in this client library are a README text file, which describes how to install and configure the Zend Framework to use the API, some example scripts you can use to create new advertiser and publisher objects, and an example.php script that implements the OAuth authentication logic and the PHP client library.

If you would like to use the PHP client library, navigate to the OpenX public GitHub location for the client libary and review the included README.md file, which explains how to install the Zend Framework (versions 1 and 2), configure OAuth authentication, and then make different API calls (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE) using the client library.

## Python Client Library

The Python client library provides a client class you can use to integrate with the OpenX Platform API, including information on how to install the library and then authenticate your application. Using the client library simplifies the application integration process because the OAuth authentication logic is automatically implemented for you. The client library includes an init.py client library example, as well as a setup.py script.

When using the Python client library, make sure to review the included README.md, which describes basic usage, client library installation, and OAuth authentication. If you select the tests folder, you will find several sample python scripts that you can use in your implementation. If you select the ox3apiclient folder, you can use in the included init.py script as part of your implementation and integration with the OpenX Platform API.

Note: Platform API users should download the latest develop branch for each API client library and should put a watch on the master branch to know when updates are available. The master currently supports API v3.

Each API client library solves connection issues for developers because they all implement OAuth.

## API client library features

Feature | Java | Python | PHP
--------- | ------- | --------- | --------- |
OAuth | X | X | X |
HTTP Delete |  | X | X|
HTTP GET | X | X | X |
HTTP POST |  | X | X |
HTTP PUT |  | X | X |
Creative upload |  |  | X |
Updates |  | X | X |
Cookie Persistence |  | X |  |

Important: The OAuth realm parameter is in the OAuth specification, but it may be missing in some OAuth client libraries. You must use the realm parameter or your client cannot do more than retrieve a request token.

Important: The Platform API client libraries support single sign-on (SSO) when 4.0 is specified in the base URI.

#Conventions

The OpenX Platform API provides the following types of resources:
  * Objects. Support CRUD operations using the following HTTP verbs:
  * ```POST```. Create the specified item
  * ```GET```. Read a representation of the resource
  * ```PUT```. Update the specified item
  * ```DELETE```. Delete the specified item
  * ```Services```. Support only read operations (i.e., ```GET```)

For a list of resources, see the API reference.

To access a resource, construct a request according to the following URI format:
```
base_URIresource/identifier/parameterparametermethod&
```
Where:
* ```method``` is an HTTP method, such as ```GET```.
* ```base-URI``` is your base URI provided by your account manager.
* ```resource``` is the name of an API object or service.
*``` identifier``` may provide a UID or a request for specific values if needed.
* ```parameter``` indicates the first URI parameter string.
* ```&parameter``` is an additional URI parameter string.

For example, in the call ```GET http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/user/available_fieldsaction=create```
* ```GET``` is the method.
* ```http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/``` is the base URI. The relative path /4.0/ indicates that your are using version 4 of the Platform API. If your base URI includes /3.0/, this API guide does not apply to your instance.
* ```user``` is an API resource.
* ```available_fields``` indicates a specific a request for information about the object's fields.
* ```action=create``` is a URI parameter string indicating that the request is for fields available upon the object's creation.

## Requests and responses

Requests to the OpenX API require a Content-Type header set to application/json. The response format for all requests is a JSON object and an HTTP response code.

OpenX API v4 calls use the following general patterns:

* ```GET /resource_type/```. List all objects or services of the specified type.
* ```GET /object_type/object_UID```. Retrieve information about the object specified by its UID.
* ```POST /object_type```. Create a new object using the values encoded in a JSON object, which must include all fields that are required for the create operation. You can make batch create requests by including multiple JSON objects.
* ```PUT /object_type```. Batch update operation. Requests include a set of valid JSON objects with any fields that are being changed by the update. You can optionally include unchanged data.
* ```PUT /object_type/object_UID```. Update the specified object with changed values specified in a JSON object. You can optionally include unchanged data.
* ```DELETE /object_type```. Batch delete operation, where the request includes multiple UIDs.
* ```DELETE /object_type/object_UID```. Delete the specified object.

The request samples in this guide use cURL (client URL request library) to send HTTP requests to access, create, and manipulate OpenX API resources.

### Create

To create a new object, send a ```POST``` request including the JSON-encoded contents of the object:

#### Sample create request
```
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/account \
	--cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string" \
	--data='{
	"account_uid": "account_uid",
	"account_id": "account_id",
	"name": "API+Demo+Advertiser",
	"country_of_business":"us",
	"currency":"USD",
	"experience":"advertiser",
	"notes":"",
	"single_ad_limitation":"0",
	"status":"Active",
	"timezone":"America/Los_Angeles",
	"type_full":"account.advertiser"
}'
```
Where: ```token_string``` is a string of characters returned by the ```GET``` session request at login.

When you create a single object, the response should contain a list with a single object.

#### Sample create response

When successful, 200 Created is returned along with the response body:
```
[
	{            
	"account_id": "account_id",
	"name": "API+Demo+Advertiser",
	"status":"Active",
	"account_type_id":"4",
	"currency":"USD",
	"timezone": "America/Los Angeles",
	"country_of_business_id":"us",
	"single_ad_limitation":"0",
	}
]
```
Where:
* ```account_uid``` is the UID of the account that was created.
* ```account_id``` is the ID of the account that was created.

For more details, see About IDs and UIDs.

### Update

To change the data on an object that already exists, send a ```PUT``` request to the object URI with the values you want to change:

#### Sample update request
```
curl -X PUT --header "Content-Type: application/json" http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/account/account_uid \
--cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string" \
  --data='{
    "status":"Inactive",
  }'
```
Where: ```account_uid``` is the UID of the account to be updated. Alternatively, you can send the ```account_id```.

#### Sample update response

The response body includes all of the object's fields:
```
[
	{
	"uid" : "account_uid",
	"name": "API+Demo+Advertiser",
	"status":"Inactive",
	"account_id":"account_id",
	"account_type_id":"4",
	"currency_id":"1",
	"timezone_id":"5",
	"country_of_business_id":"us",
	"single_ad_limitation":"0",
	"primary_contact_id":null,
	"billing_contact_id":null,
	"external_id":null
	"notes":null
	"uplift":null
	"requests":null
	"fill_rate":null
	"buyer_breakout":null
	"clicks":null
	"total_conversions":null
	}
]
```
###Delete

To delete an object, send a ```DELETE``` request to its URI:

#### Sample delete request
```
curl -X DELETE --header "Content-Type: application/json" http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/account \
			--cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string" \
		--data='["account_uid_1", "account_uid_2"]'
```
Where:

```account_uid_n``` is the UID of the account to be deleted. Alternatively, you can send account IDs.

#### Sample delete response
```
[
	{
	"account_uid_1": true,
	"account_uid_2": true
	}
]
```
### Read

To get the field values for a specific object:

#### Sample read request
```
# curl -X GET http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/account/account_uid--cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"
```
Where: ```account_uid_n``` is the UID of the account to be read.

#### Sample read response
```
[
	{
	"uid" : "account_uid"
	"name": "API+Demo+Advertiser",
	"status":"Inactive",
	"account_id":"account_id",
	"account_type_id":"4",
	"currency_id":"1",
	"timezone_id":"5",
	"country_of_business_id":"us",
	"single_ad_limitation":"0",
	"primary_contact_id":null,
	"billing_contact_id":null,
	"external_id":null
	"notes":null
	"uplift":null
	"requests":null
	"fill_rate":null
	"buyer_breakout":null
	"clicks":null
	"total_conversions":null
	}
]
```
#### Sample list request

To list all the objects of the specified type:

```
curl -X GET http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/account --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"
```

#### Batch Operations

Batch operations allow you to create, update, or delete multiple objects in one call.

##### Sample batch create
```
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" openx_server_name/ox/4.0/account \
--cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string\
--data='[
               {    "account_uid": "[Code]parent_account_uid
                     parent_account_id",
                    "account_id": "parent_account_uid",
                    "name": "Batch Account 1",
                    "type_full": "account.publisher",
                    "currency": "USD",
                    "experience": "publisher"
                },
                {
                    "account_uid": "parent_account_idcurl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" http://",
                    "account_id": "",
                    "name": "Batch Account 2",
                    "type_full": "account.advertiser",
                    "currency": "USD",
                    "experience": "advertiser"
                }
 ]'
```
##### Sample batch create response

When the creation is successful, the HTTP response includes 200 Created and a response body such as the following example:
```
[
{
    "account_uid": "
  parent_account_uid
  instance_uid",
     "acl_override": {},
     "compiled_acl": "__IGNORE__",
     "country_of_business": "us",
     "created_date": "2015-01-01 00:00:00",
     "currency": "USD",
     "currency_id": "1",
     "deleted": "0",

     "market_active": "0",
     "modified_date": "2015-01-01 00:00:00",
     "name": "Batch Account 1",
     "notes": "",
     "parent_name": "Parent Account Name",
     "payment_info": null,
     "status": "Active",
     "timezone": "UTC",
     "timezone_id": "1",
     "type": "account",
     "type_full": "account.publisher",
     "uid": "__IGNORE__",
     "v": "3"
 },
 {
     "account_id": "parent_account_uid",
     "account_uid": "instance_uid[
     "acl_override": {},
     "compiled_acl": "__IGNORE__",
     "country_of_business": "us",
     "created_date": "2015-01-01 00:00:00",
     "currency": "USD",
     "currency_id": "1",
     "deleted": "0",
     "exchange": null,
     "experience": "advertiser", 
     "external_id": null,
     "has_exchange": false,
     "has_ssrtb": false,
     "hidden": "0", 
     "id": "__IGNORE__",
     "instance_uid": "",
     "modified_date": "2015-01-01 00:00:00",
     "name": "Batch Account 2",
     "notes": "",
     "parent_name": "Parent Account Name",
     "single_ad_limitation": "0",
     "status": "Active",
     "timezone": "UTC",
     "timezone_id": "1",
     "type": "account",
     "type_full": "account.advertiser",
     "uid": "__IGNORE__",
     "v": "3"
 }
]
```
##### Sample batch delete
```
curl -X DELETE --header "Content-Type: application/json" http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/account \
--cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string \
  --data='["account_uid_1", account_uid_2", "account_uid_3", "account_uid_n]'
``` 
#### Available Fields

You can make an available_fields request to determine an object's fields and values. Some available_fields requests require URI parameters, but if you do not include them the error response will indicate what is needed. For example, if you call ```GET /account/available_fields```, you will receive the following error response:
```
{
  "attribute": "type_full", 
  "choices": [
    "account.agency", 
    "account.advertiser", 
    "account.network", 
    "account.publisher"
  ], 
  "field": {}, 
  "http_status": 400, 
  "message": "Field type_full value must be one of \"account.agency\", \"account.advertiser\", \"account.network\" or \"account.publisher\" (\"None\" not allowed)", 
  "type": "Value Error", 
  "value": null
}   
```
This response points out that you need to include a ```type_full``` request parameter in your call to the account object. For example, if you append ```?type_full=account.publisher``` to your request, the Ad Server will provide information about all the account fields for an account of type ```account.publisher```.

##### Sample ```available_fields``` request specifying a ```type_full``` value:
```
openx_server_name/ox/4.0/account/available_fields?type_full=account.publisher --cookie "openx3_access_token=curl -X GET http://token_string"

Sample available_fields response:

Where:

* acl. A field used for permissions that you can typically ignore.
* url. A path that you can follow to the base URI to return a list of options. The corresponding field will only accept values that are found in the response to the specified options call.

Tip: You can also include action=create or action=update when calling the API for available and required fields of an object. For example, the set of required fields for creating a user is different than for updating a user, such as the user.email field, which is required when creating but not when updating.

#### Pagination

The size of the data displayed in a response is limited by the following request parameters:

* limit. The maximum number of items to be returned on a single request. Its default value is 10.
* offset. The number of the first item to display for the current request, where the offset for first item on the first page is 0. Its default value is 0.

If there is too much information to display in a single page, the response body will include "has_more": true. You can access the additional values by modifying the offset and limit paging values.

##### Sample list request including pagination parameters

For example, to list account records 50 through 75, specify an offset of 50 and a limit of 25:
```
curl -X GET http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/accountoffset=50&limit=25 --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"
```
### URI parameters

The URIs described in the API reference represent the supported request syntax, to which you can add certain supported request parameters. You can include request parameters in your API calls as query string arguments; you can append the first parameter after a question mark (?) and additional parameters separated by ampersands (&) in any order or combination.
The OpenX API supports the various parameters, such as the following:

* ```action```. When calling the API for available and required fields for an object, set this parameter to action=create or action=update to specify the action for which you want to retrieve values. For example, the set of required fields for creating a user (/user/available_fields?action=create) is different than the set of required fields for updating a user (/user/available_fields?action=update), such as the user.email field, which is required for creating a user but not for updating a user.
* ```pretty```. (For debugging purposes only) Display the JSON response into a more human readable format, encapsulated by HTML tags.
* Pagination parameters.
* ```type_full```. Some available_fields calls require this parameter. If so, the error response will list the choices for type_full if you do not specify an attribute. For example, when calling /ad/available_fields, you can specify the type_full=ad.image attribute. This parameter is also used for list operations.

Important: Routine use of the pretty parameter negatively impacts performance. Do not use it in your production calls.

Depending on the resource you are calling, many additional parameters may be available. Making calls without required parameters results in an error response, which typically indicates what was missing from the request. You can call available_fields for an object to see fields listed as required: true.

#### About IDs and UIDs
OpenX API objects have object_name_id ("ID") and object_name_uid ("UID") fields. For example, you can include account_id=string or account_uid=string values in some API calls.

IDs were supported in API v3 and OpenX continues to maintain IDs. UIDs were introduced with API v4 for internal reasons and they are typically interchangeable with IDs. You can usually specify both IDs and UIDs in API requests that include a full JSON object (for an example, see Create).

You do not have to specify UIDs unless they are listed as required by the available_fields create or update response for the object. For example, to create an order, the account_uid is required. If you specify the account_id instead, the call will not work. As a best practice, you should use IDs whenever possible; however, if IDs are not available or do not work, use UIDs in their place.

### Response codes and error handling

Most ```create``` and ```update``` operations require particular parameters. The API responds with an HTTP response code of 2xx when the operation is successful or an error code of 4xx, a text description of the error, and JSON content listing the incorrect or missing fields, along with the reason they were rejected. For example, if you ```POST``` an order without any parameters, the API responds with error code 400, and JSON in the response body indicating the required fields.

The following table describes the possible error types:

Error |	Description |
----- | ----------- |
Dependency | Validation of the field failed due to restrictions based on the value of another field. The related field is specified in the ```field``` dictionary, and the field-specific error is detailed in the ```dependency``` dictionary. |
Field Permission | The current user does not have permission to modify the given field. |
Not Unique | The field requires a unique value. For example, the value might need to be unique: Across the entire instance, Within the object's parent account, Within the parent object, Within the object (in the case of an array field). |
Object Not Found | The object matching the given UID either does not exist, or was deleted. |
Object One To One | The object's parent must have exactly one child. |
Object Type | The object matching the given UID is not of the expected type. |
Object Validation | Some of the input fields did not pass validation. Each field validation error includes: Field definition in the ```field``` dictionary, Error type in ```type```, or a human-readable error in ```message```. Each field validation error is detailed in the ```field_errors``` dictionary, where the keys are field names and the values are errors. When available, the object's UID is provided in ```uid```. |
Permission | The current user does not have permission to perform the specified action on the specified object. |
Range | The input field value is either less than the minimum or greater than the maximum allowed value. |
Read Only | The field value may not be modified. |
Reference | Indicates that an object is referred to by another object and cannot be deleted. The referring objects are listed in ```referencing_objects```.
Require | The field requires a non-null value. |
Size | The input field value is too large or too small. For string fields, this is the allowed number of characters. For array fields, this is the allowed number of items in the array. |
Type | The input field value is of the wrong type, and cannot be coerced into the correct type. For example, if a date/time field cannot parse a value into a native date, this error will be raised. |
Unknown Field | The input field does not exist for the object or sub-object. |
Validation | One or more errors occurred within nested data structures. Sub-field validation errors are detailed in the error response under the following dictionaries:
* ```field_errors``` dictionary. Error details for sub-object fields
* ```item_errors``` dictionary. Error details for array fields |
Value | The allowable values for the field are constrained to a given set or must match a regular expression pattern. If the value must be one of a given set, the allowed values are specified in a request to the ```url``` in the field definition.

For information about HTTP status codes, see RFC 1945.

## Use Cases

This section describes the following common tasks using the Platform API:

* Working with accounts
* Working with inventory
* Working with event-level feeds
* Working with demand objects
* Working with comments
* Working with forecasts
* Working with reports

### Working with accounts

Depending on your use case, the account object is used in the following way:

* Advertiser accounts are containers for orders and other demand objects.
* Publisher accounts are containers for sites, ad units, and other inventory objects.
* Ad networks are containers for other accounts.

The account object fields can change as a result of different parameters such as the following:

* action
* instance configuration
* object type_full

To determine the available fields and appropriate values, you should make available_fields calls and options calls as needed. The Platform API provides informative responses even when the input has errors. Building a request may take a few attempts but the error messages will guide you to the correct request format.

To create an account:

1. Refer to the authentication topic to obtain an openx3_access_token.
2. Get the available fields for an account:

Example 1. Sample available_fields request
```
openx_server_name/ox/4.0/account/available_fields --cookie "openx3_access_token=curl http://token_string"
```
Where: 
```token_string``` is a string of characters returned by the ```GET``` session request at login.

Example 2. Sample ```available_fields``` response
```
{
    "attribute": "type_full", 
    "choices": [      "account.agency",       "account.advertiser",       "account.network",       "account.publisher"    ], 
    "field": {}, 
    "http_status": 400, 
    "message": "Field type_full value must be one of \"account.agency\", \"account.advertiser\", \"account.network\" or \"account.publisher\" (\"None\" not allowed)", 
    "type": "Value Error", 
    "value": null
}'
```
Accounts fields change based the different account types. The response indicates that a type_full value is required.

3. Modify the request by adding a ```type_full``` URI parameter:

Example 3. Sample ```type_full``` account request

```openx_server_name/ox/4.0/account/available_fieldstype_full=account.network --cookie "openx3_access_token=curl http://token_string"```

Example 4. Sample ```type_full``` account response

}
```
Within the response, several fields are marked "required": true, such as ```account_uid```. Of the required fields, most include a ```url``` field, such as ```account_uid's "url": "/options/account_options"```.

To see a list of available options, make the ```options``` calls indicated by the URLs. The following call shows an ```options``` call for only one of the required fields:

Example 5. Sample ```experience options``` request
```
openx_server_name/ox/4.0/options/network_experience_options --cookie "openx3_access_token=curl http://token_string"
```
Example 6. Sample ```experience options``` response
```
[  {    "id": "network.display",     "name": "Display Network"  },   {    "id": "network.mobile",     "name": "Mobile App Developer"  }]
```

By default, the acceptable values are the ```id``` values, such as ```network.display``` and ```network.mobile``` in the above sample. Some fields reference other API objects, such as the ```account_uid``` field. For such fields, their options call will return a list very similar to list calls (such as ```GET /account```).

Build a request to create an account using the following five fields along with ```type_full```:

Example 7. Sample create account request with experience and status typos
```
openx_server_name/ox/4.0/account --cookie "openx3_access_token=curl http://token_string" -X POST
      --header "Content-Type:application/json" --data '{"account_uid":
      "200571f0-accf-fff1-8123-0c9a66", "currency": "USD", "experience":
      "network.displayy", "name": "My Network", "status": "Activee", "type_full":
      "account.network", "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"}'
```
The API returns multiple errors and a ```field errors``` dictionary with experience and status keys indicating the values passed in are invalid.

Example 8. Sample error response
```
[  {    "field_errors": {      "experience": {        "attribute": "experience",         "choices": [          "network.mobile",           "network.display"        ], 
        "field": {
          "has_dependencies": false, 
          "readonly": false, 
          "required": true, 
          "type": "varchar", 
          "url": "/options/network_experience_options"
        }, 
        "http_status": 400, 
        "message": "Field experience value must be one of \"network.mobile\" or \"network.display\" (\"network.displayy\" not allowed)", 
        "type": "Value Error", 
        "value": "network.displayy"
      }, 
      "status": {
        "attribute": "status", 
        "choices": [          "Active",           "Inactive"        ], 
        "field": {
          "acl": "network.status", 
          "default": "Active", 
          "has_dependencies": false, 
          "readonly": false, 
          "required": true, 
          "type": "varchar", 
          "url": "/options/account_status_options"
        }, 
        "http_status": 400, 
        "message": "Field status value must be one of \"Active\" or \"Inactive\" (\"Activee\" not allowed)", 
        "type": "Value Error", 
        "value": "Activee"
      }
    }, 
    "http_status": 400, 
    "message": "Validation of new networkaccount failed:\n  status: Field status value must be one of \"Active\" or \"Inactive\" (\"Activee\" not allowed)\n  experience: Field experience value must be one of \"network.mobile\" or \"network.display\" (\"network.displayy\" not allowed)", 
    "object": "networkaccount", 
    "type": "Object Validation Error", 
    "uid": null
  }
]
```

6. Fix the mistakes and try again:

Example 9. Sample create account request
```
openx_server_name/ox/4.0/account --cookie "openx3_access_token=curl http://token_string" -X POST --header "Content-Type:application/json" --data
      '{"account_uid": "200571f0-accf-fff1-8123-0c9a66", "currency": "USD", "experience":
      "network.display", "name": "My Network", "status": "Active", "type_full":
      "account.network", "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"}'
```
The API returns the full object in the create response. Many fields that were not passed in are filled in with defaults, which depend on things such as instance settings, parent account, and other fields.

Example 10. Sample create response
```
[  {    "account_id": "537227760",     "account_uid": "200571f0-accf-fff1-8123-0c9a66",     "acl_override": {},     "country_of_business": "us",     "created_date": "2013-10-04 05:52:57",     "currency": "USD",     "currency_id": "1",     "deleted": "0",     "experience": "network.display",     "external_id": null,     "hidden": "0",     "id": "537241695",     "instance_uid": "[Code]instance_uid", 
    "modified_date": "2013-10-04 05:52:57", 
    "name": "My Network", 
    "notes": "", 
    "revision": 1, 
    "status": "Active", 
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles", 
    "timezone_id": "8", 
    "type": "account", 
    "type_full": "account.network", 
    "uid": "2005a85f-accf-fff1-8123-0c9a66", 
    "v": "3"
  }
]
```
Make a read call using the ```UID``` field of the newly created account:

Sample read account request
```
curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/account/2005a85f-accf-fff1-8123-0c9a66 --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"
```
The account appears in the response and also for list calls:

Sample list accounts request
```
curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/account --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"
```
## Working with inventory

This section describes how to use the Platform API to manage inventory objects. To retrieve the lists of inventory objects to which the current user has access:

* List all sites:
```curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/site --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"```
* List all site sections:
```curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/sitesection --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"```
* List all ad units:
```curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/adunit --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"```
* List all packages:
```curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/package --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"```
* List all audience segments:
```curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/audiencesegment --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"```

To retrieve information about specific inventory objects, use the UIDs from the list responses for the following calls:

* Read the site with the specified UID:
```curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/site/2000002b-e000-fff1-8123-0c9a66 --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"```
* Read the site section with the specified ID:
```curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/sitesection/536870925 --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"```
* Read the ad unit with the specified ID:
```curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/adunit/536871402 --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"```
* Read the package with the specified ID:
```curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/package/536870936 --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"```
* Read the audience segment with the specified ID:
```curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/audiencesegment/536871535 --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"```

### Create a site

To create a site:

1. See working with accounts to determine the account for which you want to create a site.
2. Retrieve the list of available fields for creating a site.
```curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/site/available_fields?account_uid=publisher_account_UID```
This returns the list of fields that you can set, and those that are required, for creating a site.
```
{
  "account_id": {
    "auto": true, 
    "has_dependencies": false, 
    "readonly": true, 
    "required": false, 
    "type": "int"
  }, 
  "account_uid": {
    "has_dependencies": false, 
    "readonly": false, 
    "required": true, 
    "type": "account_uid"
  },

        "refresh_country": {
          "has_dependencies": false, 
          "readonly": false, 
          "required": false, 
          "type": "varchar", 
          "url": "/options/country_options"
        }, 
        "refresh_delay": {
          "has_dependencies": false, 
          "readonly": false, 
          "required": true, 
          "type": "int"
        }, 
        "refresh_max": {
          "has_dependencies": false, 
          "readonly": false, 
          "required": true, 
          "type": "int"
        }
      }, 
      "has_dependencies": false, 
      "readonly": false, 
      "required": false, 
      "type": "object"
    }, 
    "readonly": false, 
    "required": false, 
    "type": "array"
  }, 
  "category_override": {
    "has_dependencies": false, 
    "readonly": false, 
    "required": false, 
    "type": "int"
  }, 
  "content_topic": {
    "acl": "site.default_content_settings", 
    "has_dependencies": false, 
    "readonly": false, 
    "required": false, 
    "type": "int", 
    "url": "/options/content_topic_options"
  },...
```
Create the site object, passing in, at a minimum, the required parameters, which include:

* The UID of the publisher account (account_uid)
* The name for the new site (name)
* The status for the site (status), which is described by /options/status_options_common
* The URL for the site (url)

For example, create a site for the web delivery medium.

```curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/site/available_fields?account_uid=publisher_account_UID```

The API creates the site and returns the ID for the new site object.

### Creating an ad unit

To create an ad unit:

Retrieve the list of sites to determine the one to create the ad unit for.
Retrieve the list of available fields for creating an ad unit:

```curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/adunit/available_fields --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"```

The following error response indicates that the type_full attribute is needed:
```
{
  "attribute": "type_full", 
  "choices": [
	"adunit.mobile",
	"adunit.videocompanion",
	"adunit.linearvideo",
	"adunit.nonlinearvideo",
	"adunit.web",
	"adunit.email"  ], 
	"field": {}, 
	"http_status": 400, 
	"message": "Field type_full value must be one of \"adunit.mobile\", \"adunit.videocompanion\", \"adunit.linearvideo\", \"adunit.nonlinearvideo\", \"adunit.web\" or \"adunit.email\" (\"None\" not allowed)", 
	"type": "Value Error", 
	"value": null
}
```
Specify the desired ```type_full``` value, such as adunit.web in the following sample:
```
curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/adunit/available_fields?type_full=adunit.web --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"
```
Note: When using adunit.mobile for the type_full value, you must also pass in the site_uid. For example:
```
curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/adunit/available_fields?type_full=adunit.mobile&site_uid=site_uid --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"```
```
This returns the list of fields that you can set, and those that are required, for creating a web ad unit:
```
{
  "account_id": {
    "auto": true, 
    "has_dependencies": false, 
    "readonly": true, 
    "required": false, 
    "type": "int"
  }, 
  "account_uid": {
    "auto": true, 
    "has_dependencies": false, 
    "readonly": true, 
    "required": false, 
    "type": "account_uid"
  }, 
  "alt_sizes": {
    "acl": "adunit.addl_sizes", 
    "has_dependencies": false, 
    "readonly": false, 
    "required": false, 
    "type": "varchar", 
    "url": "/options/web_size_options"
  },...
}
```
Create the ad unit object by passing in, at a minimum, the required parameters:

* The ID for the site that the ad unit belongs to (```site_uid```)
* The name for the ad unit (```name```)
* The status for the ad unit (status), which is either Active or Inactive
* The ID for the delivery medium that the new ad unit is intended to run on (```delivery_medium_id```)
* The ID for the type of ad tag to use to request ads for this ad unit, such ad image or JavaScript (```tag_type_id```)
* The type of ad unit (```type_full```) such as adunit.web

For example, create a web ad unit:
```
curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/adunit --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string" -X POST --header "Content-Type:application/json" --data '{"site_uid":
 "536870955", "name": "desired_adunit_name", "status": "Active", "delivery_medium_id": "2", "tag_type_id": "1", "content_type_id": "99", "type_full": "adunit.web", "size_id": "3"}'
```
The API creates the ad unit and returns the ID for the new ad unit object.

  ### Listing available fields for an event feed
  
  After you log in to the OpenX system that you want to access data for, you can retrieve the list of event feed files available to you per event type. For example, if you are interested in click events, retrieve the list of click event feed files. Then you can determine what files you want to download.

To retrieve the list of available data sets for a particular event type:

1. Build the URL and call the API, using the following format:
```
http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/eventfeed?type=click&range=number&format=json&pretty
```
Where:
* ```http``` is the protocol.
* ```openx_server_name``` is the hostname of the Platform API server.
* ```/ox/4.0``` is the base path for the API.
* ```/eventfeed``` is the method, or action to perform, in this case, a request for the list of event feed files.
* ```?``` indicates the start of URI parameters.
* ```type=click``` represents the ad serving event feed that you want to track; in this case, click event feed. This can be either request, impression, click, or conversion, depending on your OpenX configuration.
* ```format=json``` represents the format that you want to view the response in. This must be json.
* ```pretty``` indicates that you want the response that OpenX returns to be formatted in an easily-readable form. This parameter is useful if you are performing a manual inspection of the event feed response (that is, if you paste the URL in your browser and click ENTER).
* ```range=number``` indicates the serial number for the last feed that you looked at (located in the serial: key). The range parameter is like a bookmark that indicates where you want to continue viewing feeds. For example, use the value for the serial: key in the last feed that you viewed. Alternatively, specify the start and end parameters, but do not specify them in addition to range.

Tip: Do not use a range value of 0 because this can negatively impact the event feed.

Optional
breakdown=minutely is the default feed interval, which is not necessary to specify unless your account manager enabled a custom configuration for your account. The minutely value indicates that you want the response limited to minutely feeds only. The hourly value limits the response to hourly feeds, but it is disabled for most accounts. This field is required if you have both hourly and minutely feeds enabled. Please check with your OpenX account manager if you are unsure of what type of feed you have.
OpenX returns a JSON response similar to the one described in the sample response.

2. As necessary, look at event feed timestamps or serial numbers and rebuild the URL as necessary. To avoid inconsistencies, especially when your implementation uses an automatic system to process event feeds, use the range parameter to retrieve serial numbers in the JSON response (serial: key) as your bookmarks for viewing feeds rather than the start and end parameters.
3. Parse the response for timestamps or serial numbers and file paths and download the event feed files that you want to access.

For more details, see eventfeed in the API reference.

### Downloading the event feed file

After you parse the response for the serial numbers and feed files, you can download the files with the data you want to access. Use the URL located in the ```@locator:``` key in the JSON response (see bold text in the sample response). For example, in the sample response described in the previous section, if you wanted to download the last event feed file in the response, you would use the following URL:
```
http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/eventfeed/fetch?file=/d8568240-c334-11e2-8b8b-0800200c9a66/ox_click_log_minutely/2015-10/clicks_v4_2015-10-22_21-00_d8568240-c334-11e2-8b8b-0800200c9a66.txt.gz
```
This returns the event feed file with the data fields for the event. OpenX recommends that you validate each file by comparing the value in the ```@digest``` key with a locally executed MD5 checksum. This ensures that you have correctly downloaded a complete and valid file before moving on with further processing.

### Event feed file format

After you uncompress a GZIP feed file, you can see that the contents are UTF-8 encoded and that each file contains a header row. The feed schema indicates the field delimiter, which is a tab.

If any of the following characters occur in the source data, they are escaped with a backslash:

* tab (U+0009). Becomes a literal string \t
* newline (U+000A). Becomes a literal string \n
* backslash (U+005C). Becomes a literal string \\

## Working with demand objects

This section describes how to use the API to list or create orders, line items, ads, and creatives.
You can:

* Retrieve lists of orders, line items, and ads
* Retrieve lists of deals
* Create an order
* Create a line item
* Create an ad
* Upload a creative

### Retrieving the list of demand objects

To retrieve the list of demand objects that the current user has access to, issue one of the following HTTP GET requests:

* ```GET /order```
* ```GET /lineitem```
* ```GET /ad```

For example:

* To retrieve the list of orders:
```curl -X GET http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/order --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"```

* To retrieve the list of line items:
```curl -X GET http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/lineitem --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"```

* To retrieve the list of ads in alphabetical order:
```curl -X GET http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/ad --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string```

### Retrieve information about available deals

To retrieve a list of private marketplace deals that you are eligible to bid on, make the following options call:
```
curl -X GET http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/options/available_deals?account_uid=account_uid --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"
```
The API returns details about your eligible deals, such as shown in the following sample:
```
[
{
	buyer: [ ],
    code: "OX-Mas-ik6ReO",
    currency: {
      currency: "USD"
    },
    end_date: null,
    floor_price: "2.00",
    id: "1610624813",
    name: "special_pmp_deal",
    seller: {
      id: 357,
      name: "seller1"
    },
    start_date: "2014-10-06 07:00:00",
    type: {
      id: "2",
      name: "Private Auction"
    }
  },
  {
    buyer: [ ],
    code: "OX-Mas-acfQvL",
    currency: {
      currency: "USD"
    },
    end_date: "2014-10-31 07:00:00",
    floor_price: "4.00",
    id: "1610625435",
    name: "Oc Deal",
    seller: {
      id: 357,
      name: "seller2"
    },
    start_date: "2014-06-11 07:00:00",
    type: {
      id: "1",
      name: "Preferred Deal"
    }
  },
  {
    buyer: [ ],
    code: "OX-GI_-4oEDz9",
    currency: {
      currency: "USD"
    },
    end_date: null,
    floor_price: "11.00",
    id: "1610633711",
    name: "GI_Deal",
    seller: {
      id: 357,
      name: "seller3"
    },
    start_date: "2014-09-23 07:00:00",
    type: {
      id: "3",
      name: "Within Open Auction"
    }
  },
...
  }
]
```
If you are not eligible for any deals, the API returns an empty array:
[ ]

### Retrieve information about a demand object

Query the API for details about a specific demand object:

* ```GET /order/<order_uid>```
* ```GET /lineitem/<lineitem_uid>```
* ```GET /ad/<ad_uid>```

For example, query the API for details about order UID 20003303-c001-fff1-8123-0c9a66:
```
curl -X GET http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/order/20003303-c001-fff1-8123-0c9a66 --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"
```
The API returns the attributes and value details for the specific order:
```
[
	{
	"account_id": "537242118", 
	"account_uid": "2005aa06-accf-fff1-8123-0c9a66", 
	"budget": null,

	"v": "3", 
	"view_through_window": "86400"
	}
]
```
### Creating an order

To create an order:

Retrieve the list of accounts to determine the account UID for which you want to create the order.

Retrieve the list of available fields for creating an order.
```
curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/order/available_fields --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"
```
This returns the list of fields that you can set, and those that are required, for creating an order.
```
{
  "account_id": {
    "auto": true, 
    "has_dependencies": false, 
    "readonly": true, 
    "required": false, 
    "type": "int"
  }, 
  "account_uid": {
    "has_dependencies": false, 
    "readonly": false, 
    "required": true, 
    "type": "account_uid"
  }, 
  "budget": {
    "acl": "order.budget", 
    "has_dependencies": false, 
    "readonly": false, 
    "required": false, 
    "type": "decimal(21,2)"
  }, 
  "click_through_window": {
    "acl": "order.conversion_window", 
    "default": "86400", 
    "has_dependencies": false, 
    "readonly": false, 
    "required": false, 
    "type": "int"
  }, 
  "created_date": {
    "auto": true, 
    "has_dependencies": false, 
    "readonly": true, 
    "required": false, 
    "type": "datetime"
  },...
}
```

Create the order object, passing in, at a minimum, the required parameters, which include:

* The name of the new order (```name```)
* The status for the new order (```status```)
* The beginning date for the new order (```start_date```)
* The ID for the advertiser account that the new order belongs to (```account_uid```)

For example, create an order for a specified account:
```
curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/order --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string" -X POST
      --header "Content-Type:application/json" --data '{"account_uid":
      "20058a53-accf-fff1-8123-0c9a66", "name": "demo_order", "status": 
      "Pending", "start_date": "2014-01-21", "view_through_window": "86400",
      "click_through_window": "86400"}'
```
The API creates the order and returns the ID for the new order object.

### Creating a line item

To create a line item:

1. Create the order that you want to create the line item for, or retrieve the list of orders to determine the target order.
2. Get the list of available fields for creating a line item:
```
curl -X GET http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/lineitem/available_fields --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"
```
The following error response indicates that a type_full value is required:
```
Error response
{
	"attribute": "type_full", 
	"choices": [
	"lineitem.exchange", 
	"lineitem.house", 
	"lineitem.preferred", 
	"lineitem.exclusive", 
	"lineitem.share_of_voice", 
	"lineitem.volume_goal", 
	"lineitem.non_guaranteed"
	], 
	"field": {}, 
	"http_status": 400, 
	"message": "Field type_full value must be one of \"lineitem.exchange\", \"lineitem.house\", \"lineitem.preferred\", \"lineitem.exclusive\", \"lineitem.share_of_voice\", \"lineitem.volume_goal\" or \"lineitem.non_guaranteed\" (\"None\" not allowed)", 
	"type": "Value Error", 
	"value": null
}
```
3. Modify the request by adding a type_full URI parameter:
```
curl -X GET http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/lineitem/available_fieldstype_full=lineitem.house --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"
```
The response lists the fields that you can set and those that are required for creating a line item:
```

}
```

You can retrieve details about fields that include a url value. For example, ```ad_delivery``` includes the following value: ```"url"```: 
```
"/options/ad_delivery_options"
```
```
curl -X GET http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/options/ad_delivery_options --cookie
      "openx3_access_token=token_string"
```
Create the line item object, passing in, at a minimum, the required parameters, which include:

* The ad delivery method (```ad_delivery```)
* The name of the line item (```name```)
* The status of the line item (```status```)
* The ID for the order that the line item belongs to (```order_uid```)
* The beginning date for the line item (```start_date```)
* The delivery medium (```delivery_medium```)
* Targeting rules (```targeting```)
* The type of line item (```type_full```)

For example, create a house line item:
```
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/lineitem \
--cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string" \
  --data='{
    "ad_delivery":"manual",
    "delivery_medium":"WEB",
    "name":"Demo line item",
    "status":"Pending",
    "order_uid":"20004055-c001-fff1-8123-0c9a66",
    "start_date":"now",
    "targeting":{"geographic":{"value_count":0},"content":{"value_count":0},"inter_dimension_operator":"OR"}
    "type_full":"lineitem.house",
    "account_uid":"2005aa92-accf-fff1-8123-0c9a66"
    }'
```    
The API creates the line item and returns the UID for the new line item object.

### Creating an ad

To create an ad:

Create a line item and retrieve its UID, or retrieve the list of line items to determine the one to create the ad for.
Upload a creative.
Create a creative.
Get the list of available fields for creating an ad:
```
curl -X GET http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/ad/available_fields?type_full=ad.image --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"
```
The following error response indicates that a ```type_full``` value is required:

### Working with forecasts

The OpenX Platform API provides the ability to forecast the impact of creating a new line item on existing line items. Much like the OpenX UI, the API enables you to perform a number of different forecasting actions to create and manage forecasts. Before using the Forecasting API, you should already be familiar with how forecasting works using the OpenX user interface. If, however, you are unfamiliar with how forecasting works, refer to the Forecasting documentation for more information on forecasts and availability.

Forecasting enables you to:
* Get a picture of how much inventory you will have available to sell.
* Plan your inventory setup so you can get a better idea of potential revenue.
* Calculate seasonality for your revenue, or the predicted number of impressions for the past year, based on historical trends.
* Forecast performance.
* Ensure you have enough inventory to fulfill any existing delivery goals for guaranteed line items.

When working with forecasting, you have the option to either use the OpenX user interface or API to run forecasts. This section describes how to run forecasts using the Forecasting API.

#### API request structure

When you make an API request, you must follow the standard HTTP API request structure to ensure the request is properly formatted. You can find more information about how to construct an HTTP request in the Conventions section of this Developer's Guide.

#### Running a forecast

There are different operations you can perform using the Forecasting API. Typically, when you run a forecast, you want to see what impact, if any, adding a new line item will have on existing line items and revenue. By making a single call with your desired arguments, you will see the impact of your line item on other line items and revenue.

The example steps below describe how to run a forecast with revenue information.

Note: These steps assume you have already been authenticated. If you have not been authenticated, refer to the Authentication section for the steps on how to authenticate your application.

From your terminal window, make the following cURL request.
```
curl '<your server instance>/ox/4.0/forecast_augur/my_availability_forecasts' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/javascript' -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -H 'Cookie: i=d7e17e57-71d3-4c33-22e3-d51789f40aba|1444755321; openx3_access_token=3fbacd1bad501a6f503b3300ace57a1e48cd4c9b0e541f0a9f39dd20668ba38750ee6ff445fcac2c20a429f11c8191825e828cc1ba845c674bc1a1c4eb9a12560561d38d1'--data-binary '{"start_date":"2015-10-13 00:00:00","end_date":"2015-10-31 00:00:00","buying_model":"exclusive","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","pricing_rate":".50","full_oxtl_rule_id":"e02d9dc977cddb2860eafb70a7d920db","targeting_rule":"58a334fe-c92e-4e48-add8-cefe0c89b0fc","currency":"USD","make_good":true,"adunit_uid":"all"}'

You can then perform one of the following API requests to return a list of available ```full_oxtl_rule_id``` and ```targeting_rule``` values. These values are defined as follows:

* ```full_oxtl_rule_id``` - The ID of the targeting rule that you are creating, and contains all the information that you have entered - name, inventory, and the rest of the targeting critieria.
* ```targeting_rule``` - The ID of the forecasting object that was created *from* the full oxtl rule. This is the object that is created that forecasting really cares about - which only contains a subset of the targeting critieria that you entered initially.

You will want to make these API calls so you can view the different targeting rules available before running a forecast.
```
curl '<your server instance>/ox/4.0/forecast_augur/forecastrules?avail2=true' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/javascript, /; q=0.01' -H 'X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest' -H 'Accept-Language: en-us' -H 'X-Openx-Client: 4.43.0.2335' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/46.0.2490.86 Safari/537.36' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --compressed
```

In each of these API calls, there are a number of arguments that can be passed with the call, which are listed in the table below.

Request Value |	Value |
----------- | -------- |
Your server address. |	your server instance |
The OpenX client. | ox |
The API version. | 4.0 |
The forecasting service. | ```forecast_augur``` |
The available targeting rules and rule IDs you can use in a forecast. | forecastrules |
The application header used in the request. | -H 'Accept: application/json, text/JavaScript, /; q=0.01'|
The HTTP request. | -H 'X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest'|
The client header, including language (en-us). | -H 'Accept-Language: en-us' -H 'X-Openx-Client: 4.43.0.2335'|
The user agent header used in the request, including browser and operating system. | -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/46.0.2490.86 Safari/537.36'|
The application header returned to the client. | -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --compressed |

When making this request, the server processes the request and runs a forecast, displaying the forecast. The table below describes each value returned in the response.

Response Value | Description |
------------ | ----------- |
status | The status response is used to perform data massaging for response messages since there are special cases for the API. The following response values can be returned: 0=successful, 1=unsuccessful. |
goal | The impression goal of the line item for the dates given. |
impacted line items | Line items in the forecast that are impacted with your new line item. For each impacted line item, you will see the following values: loss, goal, previousAllocated, revenueLost, newAllocated, pricingRate, buyingModel, id, name. |
pricingRate | The given pricing rate the user entered. 0.0 is returned if no pricing rate was given. |
msg | Message that acknowledges whether the forecast was run successfully. |
allocated | The total number of allocated impressions for this line item. |
forecasted | The total number of forecasted impressions for this line item. This value is what the line item was forecasted to deliver on, but because of competing line items, did not meet the full forecasted impressions. You can get the unsold impressions by calculating forecasted - allocated = unsold impressions. |

## Working with history

You can get history information associated with an object by making a ```GET``` request to the OpenX Server. For more information about the history feature, see History.

Note: All examples assume that you have been authenticated.

1. From the terminal window on your system, make the following ```GET``` request to the OpenX server (in this case, an order):
```
curl -v -X GET 'http://server_name.openx.net/ox/4.0/audittrail?obj_type=order&obj_id=1611010849'  -H "Content-Type:application/json"--cookie $COOKIE | python -mjson.tool
```
The values listed in the table below are available for the GET request to the OpenX server.

Value | Description |
------- | ------------ |
sort | Sorts the output by revision. Options: sort=revision: Returns search results by revision in ascending order, sort=-revision: Returns search results by revision in descending order. |
obj_type | Specifies the object type. For example: obj_type='ad'. |
offset=m | Specifies an offset value for a history record search. For example, to bypass the first ten records and start searching at the eleventh record, use "offset=10". To return the second ten records, use "offset=10 limit 10". |
limit=n	| Returns the most recent n history records. |
revision | Specifies a revision number. For example, to return one history record, use the obj_id and revision. |
timestamp | Use timestamp to return history information for an object based on a date or date range. For example, use timestamp > or timestamp < to specify history after or before a specific date. Operators include >, <, =, >=, <=, and !=. timestamp format is YYYY-MM-DD.|
obj_id	| Specifies an object's id. When just an object id is specified, returns all parsed history records for the specified object revision, displaying the most recent first.|
user | Specifies the user, indicated by an email address, who made a modification to an object. |

2. The OpenX server processes the ```GET``` request and returns a list of all history information for the specified order object. An example of history is shown below.
```

offset | The distance (displacement) from the beginning of the object until a given element. | 0 |

Examples

Note: The following samples show both ways to create a history call:

* specify an object type and specific object (obj_id) and then append history (```audittrail```) parameters
* query the history (```audittrail``) endpoint and pass in the object type, object id, and additional parameters

Note: Also, the following samples show the abbreviated form of the ```GET``` call as opposed to a full curl call.

Return object history with limit and sort

The following sample returns the history of changes for order number 1611010849. The default settings are: "limit=20 sort=-revision".

```GET``` Request

Object id first; history parameters second
```

Additional Samples

Note: The following samples show only the second way to create a history call (by querying the history (audittrail) endpoint and passing in the object type, object id, and additional parameters).

Note: The following samples show the full ```curl``` call.

Return all history for an object

The following sample returns all history records for the specified object id. If more than ten records exist in the database, it returns the most recent ten. To return more than ten records, use limit=int.

```GET``` Request
```
curl -v -X GET 'http://server_name.openx.net/ox/4.0/audittrail?&obj_id=object_id'  -H "Content-Type:application/json"--cookie $COOKIE | python -mjson.tool
```
Return history for a specified revision

The following sample returns one history record for the specified object id and the specified revision.

```GET``` Request
```
curl -v -X GET 'http://server_name.openx.net/ox/4.0/audittrail?&obj_id=object_id&revision=integer'  -H "Content-Type:application/json"--cookie $COOKIE | python -mjson.tool
```
Return history modified by a specified user

The following sample returns all history records for the specified object id that were modified by the specified user (indicated by the email address).

```GET``` Request
```
curl -v -X GET 'http://server_name.openx.net/ox/4.0/audittrail?&obj_id=object_id&user=email_address'  -H "Content-Type:application/json"--cookie $COOKIE | python -mjson.tool
```
Return object history after a specified date

The following sample returns all history records for the specified object id, with a timestamp greater than (>) a specified date.

```GET``` Request
```
curl -v -X GET 'http://server_name.openx.net/ox/4.0/audittrail?&obj_id=object_id&timestamp>2016-01-01'  -H "Content-Type:application/json"--cookie $COOKIE | python -mjson.tool
```
Return object history with offset and limit

The following sample returns all history records for the specified object id, with a limit of 30 and an offset of 10.

```GET``` Request
```
curl -v -X GET 'http://server_name.openx.net/ox/4.0/audittrail?&obj_id=object_id&limit=30&offset=10'  -H "Content-Type:application/json"--cookie $COOKIE | python -mjson.tool
```
Return object history with offset, limit, and sort

The following sample returns all history records for the specified object id, with a limit of 30 and an offset of 10, sorted by timestamp (descending).

```GET``` Request
```
curl -v -X GET 'http://server_name.openx.net/ox/4.0/audittrail?&obj_id=object_id&limit=30&offset=10&sort=-timestamp'  -H "Content-Type:application/json"--cookie $COOKIE | python -mjson.tool

### Accessing Reports via OpenX Reporting API

Even though you can access reports using the OpenX user interface, you may also run these same reports using the OpenX API. You can perform many of the same steps in accessing reports using the API as you would when using the OpenX user interface, with the main difference being that you will only need to make a single API request to configure the date range and attributes you want to see in the report.

If you decide to access reports via the OpenX API, it is assumed you are already intimately familiar with reporting and understand how these reports are configured and generated. If you are unfamiliar with OpenX reporting, please refer to the OpenX Reporting documentation for more detailed information about how reports are managed in the user interface.

To run simple reporting service (SRS) reports, make the following report object calls:

1. ```GET /report/get_reportlistList``` all reports that are available to you based on your account and user permissions. The reports listed by this request typically correspond to the SRS reports available to you in the OpenX UI.

Sample request:
```
curl http://openx_server_name/ox/4.0/report/get_reportlist --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"
```
Where:
token_string is a string of characters returned by the ```GET``` request at login. To obtain an ```openx3_access_token```, see the authentication topic.
```

4. Parse the JSON response for use with your reporting integration.

## Authentication Via Client Libraries
Before you can access reports via the OpenX API, you must first be authenticated. You can use an existing OpenX client library or your own library. If you use one of these client libraries, the back-end authentication logic is automatically implemented for you via the client library and you need not perform any OAuth implementation steps. If, however, you choose to write your own client library, you will then need to implement the OAuth authentication logic yourself.

For more detailed information on how to implement authentication logic, refer to the Authentication section.

## Running a Report Using the OpenX API

When generating reports, you likely will want to use a program to make these calls on an predetermined automated basis (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.). If, however, you wish to make these API calls manually, or through a browser, then the examples below provide the necessary information for you to make these individual calls through a terminal window or browser.

When making a request using the API, there are a number of parameters you may pass in your request which will present specific information you want displayed in the report. Although there are only a few required input parameters you need to pass in the request, there are a number of other parameters you can include in your request.

Note: : There are two different report formats you can use in your request: CSV & JSON. you can specify the report format by entering format (csv or JSON) in the report_format parameter.

### Bid Performance Report Example
One type of report you may wish to run is the Bid Performance Report, which provides insight into bid activity based on inventory, demand, and Private Marketplace deal information. This can help you evaluate both Ad Exchange and Private Marketplace performance.
When you make the Bid Performance Report request, the report is generated with different columns based on the input parameters and the breakout columns you have specified.

Report Columns
Column | Description |
-------- | ---------- |
Date | The date the report was generated. |
PublisherName | The name of the publisher. |
PublisherID | The ID associated with the publisher. |
SiteName | The name of the site. |
AdUnit | The name of the ad unit. |
AdUnitID | The ID associated with the ad unit.|
AdUnitSize | The size of the ad unit.|
DeliveryMedium | The attribute reports off the "Default Delivery Medium" set at the site level.|
DemandPartner | The demand side platform the buyer is using for the deal. |
DemandPartnerID	| The ID associated with the demand side platform the buyer is using for the deal.|
Buyer | The Buyer that is represented by the Exchange entity or DSP (Demand Partner). |
AdvertiserName | The Advertiser represented by the Buyer and owner of the brand being advertised. |

Note: : It is assumed you have already been authenticated to use the OpenX Platform API. If you are not already authenticated, use your login credentials to log into your OpenX server instance. Also, because these are daily reports, data will be displayed for a day.

The table below lists the different metrics that can be returned in a report.

Report Metrics

Metric | Description |
------- | ----------- |
Impressions | The total number of impressions delivered, excluding PSA, house, and companion ads for the selected date range.|
Revenue	| The total revenue received for this date range.|
CPM | Revenue per thousand impressions.|
Bid Requests | The number of bid requests sent to the demand partner.|
Opportunities | The number of eligible bid opportunities sent to the demand partner. An opportunity is counted each time the buyer has a chance to win an impression. For example, if the bid was eligible for two deals of different priority, and had the opportunity to bid in both deals because the first deal did not fell the impression, these would be counted as two opportunities. On the other hand, if the buyer wins the impression from the first deal by meeting the deal criteria, then the second deal does not count as an opportunity. |
Eligibility Rate | = Opportunities/Bid Requests |
Bids | The number of positive bids.|
Bid Rate | = (Bids/Bid Requests) |
Win Rate | = (Impressions/Bid Requests) |
Bid Fill Rate | = (Impressions/Bid Requests) |
Bid CPM	| (Sum of bid amounts for all bids/bids) x 1000. Average bid for this date range. Includes both winning and losing bids.|
Win CPM	| = (Sum of bid amounts for all winning bids/impressions) x 1000. The average winning bid for this date range.|

The examples below illustrate several different types of Bid Performance Reports, each request passing different parameters. This enables you to see how passing these parameters causes the report to display different sets of information.

Note: : Please remember these are daily reports so data will be displayed for a day.

If you would like to generate a Bid Performance Report with no additional optional (breakout) columns displayed, run the following command from your terminal window:
```
curl '<api_url>'/ox/4.0/report/run?start_date=2016-01-19 10:00:00&end_date=2016-01-19 15:00:00&report_format=csv&report=bid_perf
```
The table below lists the parameters being passed in this request.

#### Making a cURL Request
You may also generate a Bid Performance Report by making a single cURL call. Like the URL example above, this example assumes you are already logged in and authenticated; however, unlike the example above, make sure you take note of the cookie information, as you will need to include this information in your cURL call.

To generate a Bid Performance Report using a single cURL call, enter the following command:
```

## Authentication reference

### What is authentication?

If you are developing your own client application to access OpenX, you will have to authenticate your users. OpenX authentication follows the OAuth 1.0 protocol. From the OAuth specification:

The OAuth protocol enables websites or applications (Consumers) to access Protected Resources from a web service (Service Provider) via an API, without requiring Users to disclose their Service Provider credentials to the Consumers. More generally, OAuth creates a freely-implementable and generic methodology for API authentication.

The following sections provide a brief overview that describes how to code your own OAuth scheme to access the OpenX API.

### Before you begin

What You Will Need

If you decide to implement your own authentication code, here is what you will need:

* Basic knowledge of OAuth. For more information you can consult the following recommended sites: OAuth specification, The OAuth Bible, and Twitter Developers Documentation: OAuth.
* Knowledge of the HTTP protocol
* For programmatic authentication, you need to have knowledge of a client language such as PHP, Python, or Java. Note that OpenX already provides client libraries for each of these languages.

Credentials Supplied by OpenX

When you become an API customer, OpenX provides you with the following credentials which you will use in initial authentication calls.

Credentials Supplied by OpenX

Parameter | Description |
Username | Your account username provided by your account manager. |
Password | Your account password provided by your account manager. |
Consumer Key | The ID portion of your Consumer credentials, provided by your account manager. |
Consumer Secret | The Consumer secret can be thought of as the password for the Consumer credentials. This is also provided by your account manager. |
OAuth Realm | The realm value is a string, generally assigned by the origin server. The realm parameter allows the protected resources on a server to be partitioned. For example, OAuth realm="http://server.example.com/" |

### About OAuth

The following section briefly describes the concepts and workflow of the OAuth authentication process.

Tip: For more details about OAuth, refer to RFC 5849.

Roles

The OAuth process involves the following three entities:

* The double-headed arrow between the User and Consumer shows that a request and response is made between the two.
* The double-headed arrow between the Consumer and the Service Provider shows that a request and response takes place between the two.
* The arrow at the bottom shows that, after the OAuth process, the User is able to access resources from the Service Provider.

OAuth Roles
OAuth Role | Description | OpenX Implementation |
Service Provider | A web application that allows access via OAuth. | OpenX |
Consumer | A website or application that uses OAuth to access the Service Provider on behalf of the User. | Your client application. |
User | An individual who has an account with the Service Provider. | Users of your client application. |

URLs
OAuth defines three request URLs:

URL Type | Description | OpenX Implementation |
Request Token URL | Used to obtain an unauthorized Request Token | https://sso.openx.com/api/index/initiate | 
User Authorization URL | Used to obtain User authorization for Consumer access | Browser-based: https://sso.openx.com/login/login Programmatic: https://sso.openx.com/login/process | 
Access Token URL | Used to exchange the User-authorized Request Token for an Access Token | https://sso.openx.com/api/index/token

Parameters

For a complete list of parameters, see the OAuth specification. There are a few parameters worth mentioning:

Parameter | Description |
Oauth_nonce | This parameter contains a nonce or "only once string"; it is a unique string that changes on each OAuth request. There is no specification on how the nonce should be constructed, but it is important to make sure it changes on each call; it is how the server knows there are no duplicate requests. |
oauth_token | This value changes based on the stage of the OAuth handshake. Before authorization and when getting a request token, this parameter is excluded entirely. When retrieving an access token, this parameter is set to the request token. Once an access token has been obtained, this parameter, for all future requests, is set to the access token. |
UNIX timestamp | The oauth_timestamp field requires a UNIX timestamp. Some programming libraries may provide a function for this. |

Process Overview
The following graphic illustrates the flow of information in the OAuth process. It takes place is basically three steps:

* The Consumer obtains an unauthorized Request Token (Steps 1.1 and 1.2)
* The User authorized the Request Token (Steps 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3)
* The Consumer exchanges the Request Token for an Access Token (Steps 3.1 and 3.2)

The numbered steps in the graphic correspond to the numbered steps in this section.

### About signing requests

#### Signing Requests

OAuth defines a method for validating the authenticity of HTTP requests. This method is called Signing Requests. Instead of sending full credentials (specifically passwords), OAuth uses digital signatures with each request. Digital signatures allow the recipient to verify that the content of the request has not changed in transit. To do that, the sender uses a mathematical algorithm to calculate the signature of the request and includes it with the request.

All of your requests must be signed using the HMAC-SHA1 hashing algorithm. The server checks your hash to make sure it matches the hash it generates. If it does, the data you sent has not been compromised. The following explains how to sign requests.

#### Base String

To authenticate programmatically:

Create a "base string" using the "resource url" and the HTTP method (POST, GET) you will use before that:

```POST http://sso_openx.com```

Next, sort all of your parameters in alphabetical order. (Each request will be accompanied by a set of parameters. Each step in the process requires a different set of parameters, as described in the following sections. Alphabetically sorting them ensures that the hashing algorithm produces the same result on both Consumer and Provider sides).

Add a URL-encoded equal sign and value to each parameter. For every parameter except the last one, add a URL-encoded ampersand.

Add all of the parameters to the string you started in step 1.

The result is the final Base String. An example Python base string is shown below.

```POST&http%3A%2F%2Fsso_openx.com%2Fapi%2Ftest.json&parama%3Dparamaval%26paramb%3Dparambval %26version%3D1.0```

The parameter name and parameter value should be URL-encoded. You can build a function to handle URL encoding. Also make sure the URL itself is encoded.

#### Hashing

The Base String is hashed using token credentials. Token credentials are different depending on what part of the OAuth handshake you are currently performing. If you're asking for a request token, your token credentials are the Consumer secret followed by an ampersand (&) often called a "dangling ampersand". This is because you don't have a token yet, so there is no token secret.

If you have a request token and are requesting an access token, your token credentials are the Consumer secret, an ampersand (&), and the request token secret. If youÌve received authorization and can now make requests on the User's behalf, your token credentials are the Consumer secret, followed by an ampersand (&), followed by the access token secret. Whichever string is relevant to you, this string is what you apply as the key when applying the HMAC-SHA1 hashing algorithm. The Base String is the value to hash. You send your final signature to the server along with the rest of the request as the oauth_signature parameter.

#### URL Encoding

When you transmit special characters over the internet, they must be encoded so that they do not get misrepresented as meaningful characters. URL-encoding converts special-purpose characters such as the ampersand into hexadecimal notation based on the character's ASCII value. For instance, the ASCII value for a space ( ) character is 32. In binary, it looks like:

0010 0000

which is 0x20 in hexadecimal notation, so the URL-encoded space character is:

%20

Most language libraries, such as Python, provide a function to encode URLs.

#### Executing an HTTP Call

OAuth specifies three ways to send credentials:

* On the query string (not recommended)
* POST parameters (OK, but may have problems)
* The authorization HTTP header (recommended)

A header is at the front of an HTTP request and gives the server information about the type of request, the length in bytes of the request, etc. For OAuth, one more header is added: "Authorization". The following shows the header. Line breaks have been inserted for readability, but when building your header, you would not include these line breaks.
```
Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key="xxxx",
oauth_token="xxxx",
oauth_version="1.0",
oauth_signature="xxxx",
```

### Methods of authentication

You can authenticate in two ways:

* Browser-Based - Use browser-based authentication if you are providing an interactive web-based login form for users other than yourself.
* Programmatically - Use programmatic authentication if you are accessing OpenX protected resources with your own credentials only and don't plan on providing a web-based login form for other users.

#### Technical Differences

The following sections show the differences between browser-based and programmatic authentication.

URL Differences
Browser-based | Different? | Programmatic |
https://sso.openx.com/api/index/initiate | No | https://sso.openx.com/api/index/initiate |
https://sso.openx.com/login/login | Yes | https://sso.openx.com/login/process |
https://sso.openx.com/api/index/token | No | https://sso.openx.com/api/index/token. |

Callback URL Difference

Browser-based | Programmatic |
Your applications' callback URL | oob (out of band)

Cookie Difference
Browser-based | Programmatic |
Does not require that you persist the access token in a cookie. When the user has completed the session, the access token will be released. | Requires that you persist the access token in a cookie named openx3_access_token until the session is complete.

### Browser-based authentication

Use Case: You would use browser-based authentication if you are providing an interactive web-based login form for users other than yourself.

Browser-based SSO logins redirect the User back to their application and pass oauth_token and oauth_verifier onto the end of the specified callbackUrl.

Authenticating a User using OAuth involves the following steps:

Step 1 - The Consumer (your application) requests and obtains an unauthorized request token
Step 2 - Authorize the User
Step 3 - Request an access token
Step 4 - Use the access token to access protected resources

These steps are described in detail below.

Step 1 - The Consumer (your application) requests and obtains an unauthorized request token

The client application requests and obtains a request token from the OAuth server (https://sso.openx.com/api/index/initiate). The request command also passes in the value of the callbackUrl parameter (the URL to which the OAuth server will redirect the User upon successful authentication).

Sub-Step 1.1 - The client application sends a ```POST``` request to ```https://sso.openx.com/api/index/initiate``` including the parameters listed below.

Sub-Step 1.2 - When OpenX receives the request, it verifies the request using its copy of the Consumer secret and returns a response to the client application, including the request token.

The client application sends a ```POST``` request for a request token. The first step requests a request token using the parameters listed below.

Parameter |	Description |
--------- |    ------------ |
oauth_realm |	The realm value is a string, generally assigned by the origin server. The realm parameter allows the protected resources on a server to be partitioned. For example, oauth realm="http://server.example.com/". |
oauth_consumer_key | The Consumer Key, supplied to you by OpenX. |
oauth_signature_method | The signature method the Consumer used to sign the request. |
oauth_signature | The signature is created using the signature process which encodes the Consumer Secret and Token Secret into a verifiable value which is included with the request. For the first request (for the request token), no Token Secret yet exists. So, the signature creation process uses the Consumer Secret and an empty Token Secret. |
oauth_timestamp |  The timestamp is expressed in the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT. The timestamp value MUST be a positive integer and MUST be equal or greater than the timestamp used in previous requests. |
oauth_nonce |	The Consumer must generate a Nonce value that is unique for all requests with the timestamp. A nonce is a random string, uniquely generated for each request. The nonce allows the Service Provider to verify that a request has never been made before and helps prevent replay attacks when requests are made over a non-secure channel (such as HTTP). |
oauth_version |	Optional. If present, value must be 1.0. Service Providers must assume the protocol version to be 1.0 if this parameter is not present. Service Providers' response to non-1.0 value is left undefined. |
oauth_callback | For browser-based authentication, use this parameter to specify to which URL the User will be re-directed. For programmatic authentication, use oob (out of band). |

Sub-step 1.2 - Service Provider (OpenX) returns an unauthorized request token.
The result of step one provides your client application (the Consumer) with an unauthorized request token and oauth_token_secret. The next step allows your User to authorize the request token. To do so, the client application redirects the User to the authorization server (OpenX) login page.

Step 2 - Authorize the User
The User can now authenticate to SSO using the Authorize URL (https://sso.openx.com/login/login), passing in the request token. If successful, the SSO server redirects the User to the callbackUrl (with the oauth_token and oauth_verifier query string parameters appended).

Substep 2.1 - For browser-based authentication, the client application (Consumer) should redirect the User to a login page using a POST request using the url: https://sso.openx.com/login/login. The POST request also passes in the unauthorized request token (oauth_token).

Substep 2.2 - The User grants access to the client application by entering a valid username and password. The OpenX authorization server generates an authorized request token.

Substep 2.3 - The Service Provider redirects the User to the URL specified by the callback URL (callbackUrl). The response includes both the oath_token and the oath_verifier.

Sub-step 2.1 Consumer directs the User to Service Provider (OpenX)
The Consumer (your app) redirects the User to the Service Provider by constructing an HTTP GET request to the Service Provider's User Authorization URL with the following parameters:

Parameter | 	Description |
--------- |    ------------ |
oauth_token | The unauthorized request token obtained in the previous step. |
oauth_callback | The Consumer should specify a URL the Service Provider will use to redirect the User back to the Consumer when Obtaining User Authorization is complete. |

Sub-step 2.2 The Service Provider obtains the User's user name and password.

The Service Provider verifies the User's identity by obtaining the User's username and password.

Sub-step 2.3 The Service Provider redirects the User back to the Consumer site.

After the User authenticates with the Service Provider and grants permission for Consumer access, the Service Provider notifies the Consumer that the Request Token has been authorized by doing the following: The Service Provider constructs an HTTP ```GET``` request URL using the provided ```oauth_callback```, and redirects the User's web browser back to that URL with the following parameters:

Parameter | 	Description |
--------- |     ----------- |
oauth_token | The Request Token the User authorized or denied. |
oauth_verifier | The verification code. |

Step 3 - Request an access token

After the User has been authenticated in Step 2, in Step 3, the client application exchanges the authorized request token for an access token. The client application makes a ```POST``` request to ```https://sso.openx.com/api/index/token``` while passing the required parameters including ```oath_token``` and ```oath_verifier```. The OpenX authorization server verifies the parameters and returns the access token in the response.

The Consumer exchanges the (temporary) Request Token for a (permanent) Access Token capable of accessing the Protected Resources. Obtaining an Access Token includes the following sub-steps:

Sub-step 3.1 - Consumer (your application) requests an access token
Sub-step 3.2 - The Service Provider (OpenX) grants an access token

Substep 3.1 - The Consumer (Your application) requests an access token.

The Request Token and Token Secret are exchanged for an Access Token and Token Secret. To request an Access Token, the Consumer makes an HTTP request to the Service Provider's Access Token URL. The Service Provider documentation specifies the HTTP method for this request, an HTTP ```POST``` is recommended. The request MUST be signed per Signing Requests, and contains the following parameters:

Parameter |	Description |
--------- |     ----------- |
oauth_consumer_key | The Consumer Key, supplied to you by OpenX. |
oauth_token | The Request Token obtained previously. |
oauth_signature_method | The signature method the Consumer used to sign the request. |
oauth_signature	| The signature is created using the signature process which encodes the Consumer Secret and Token Secret into a verifiable value which is included with the request. |
oauth_timestamp	| The timestamp. See previous description. |
oauth_nonce | The Consumer must generate a Nonce value that is unique for all requests with the timestamp. See previous description. |
oauth_version |	Optional. If present, value must be 1.0. Service Providers must assume the protocol version to be 1.0 if this parameter is not present. Service Providers' response to non-1.0 value is left undefined. |
oauth_callback | For browser-based authentication, use this parameter to specify to which URL the User will be re-directed. For programmatic authentication, use oob (out of band). |

No additional Service Provider specific parameters are allowed when requesting an Access Token to ensure all Token related information is present prior to seeking User approval.

Sub-step 3.2 - Service Provider Grants an Access Token (Response)

The Service Provider generates an Access Token and Token Secret and returns them in the HTTP response body. Your application must store the Access Token and Token Secret and use them when signing Protected Resources requests. The response contains the following parameters:

Parameter |	Description |
--------- |     ----------- |
oauth_token | The Access Token. |
oauth_token_secret | The Token Secret. |

Step 4 - Use the access token to access protected resources

The client application uses the access token to perform OpenX API operations.

### Programmatic authentication

Use Case: You would use programmatic authentication if you are accessing OpenX protected resources with your own credentials only and don't plan on providing a web-based login form for other Users.

To run automated processes, include a valid username and password in your code or make them available to the code. If successful, programmatic logins return ```oauth_token``` and ```oauth_verifier``` in the body of the response.

Important: Your client application must be able to persist cookies across an HTTP 302 redirect in a cookie named ```openx3_access_token```, which must be present in all API requests.

Authenticating a User using OAuth involves the following steps:

Step 1 - Request an unauthorized request token
Step 2 - Authorize the User
Step 3 - Request an access token
Step 4 - Use the access token to access protected resources

These steps are the same as Browser-Based Authentication except for a few details, which will be explained in each step. Only the differences will be explained in this procedure.

Step 1 - Request an unauthorized request token

Difference between programmatic and browser-based authentication:

Because this is programmatic authentication instead of browser-based, you must set the callbackUrl to oob (out-of-band), which tells the OAuth server that you are not redirecting a User to a URL. The OAuth Server returns the request token.

Step 2 - Authorize the User

Difference between programmatic and browser-based authentication:

Authorize the request token by sending an HTTP ```POST``` request to https://sso.openx.com/login/process with the following parameters:

Parameter | Description |
Email | The User's email address |
Password | The User's password |
oauth_token | The OAuth request token |

Sub-steps
For programmatic authentication, the client application must pass in the request token (oauth_token) and the User's email and password to https://sso.openx.com/login/process (NOT https://sso.openx.com/login/login).

Step 3 - Request an access token
Difference between programmatic and browser-based authentication:

This process is the same as browser-based authentication with the addition of a third sub-step:
Sub-step 3.3: Consumer (your application) persists the access token in a cookie

The Consumer (your application) should now persist the access token in a cookie so that it can be used to access the protected resources. The cookie should be named openx3_access_token, which must be present in all API requests.

Step 4 - Use the access token to access protected resources
Difference between programmatic and browser-based authentication:
None

The client application uses the access token to perform OpenX API operations.

Important: You must refresh the OpenX session at least once every two hours or your session will expire.

Important: Passwords expire after six months. Ten days before your password expires, OpenX will send you an email reminder to change your password.

Logging out
When finished with your API session, you should terminate it explicitly by sending DELETE /session to log out.

#### Programmatic authentication sample

All calls to the Platform API must be authenticated with a security token, which you can retrieve through the OpenX OAuth Server located at https://sso.openx.com. You can then include the token in subsequent API calls.

The following sample OAuth session log shows successfully signed OAuth requests using the following calls:

Step 1 - ```POST /api/index/initiate```
Step 2 - ```POST /login/process```
Step 3 - ```POST /api/index/token```

In the final call to sso.openx.com/api/index/token, the oauth_token value in the response is the value used for the openx3_access_token cookie for API requests.

Step 1 - Request an unauthorized request token

The following sample shows the values for the header fields. To send these values on a command line, you could use curl but your client application will most likely transfer these values using your preferred language (PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, etc.)

Syntax

```curl -X GET http://<openx_server_name>/ox/4.0/account/<account_uid> --cookie "openx3_access_token=token_string"```

Example

```curl -X GET http://openx_myserver.com/ox/4.0/account/879546 --cookie "openx3_access_token=e735c37c5cl...9778j1on41v6rj5"```

## Release notes

### May 4, 2016

#### TFCD Query Argument Added

The tfcd query argument has been added to the Ad Request API request parameters to ensure COPPA compliance. Possible values are 0 and 1.

0 = Not COPPA compliant
1 = COPPA compliant

For more information about the tfcd query argument, refer to the Ad Tag Parameters page.

### February 11, 2016

#### 'Adproduct' call removed

For this release, all ```adproduct``` calls have been removed and are no longer accessible to users via the OpenX UI and Platform API.

Updated ad tags

OpenX ad tags are now automatically updated to detect HTTP/HTTPS. Ad tags are now protocol-less and will work automatically for both secure and non-secure sites without requiring users to manually change the tags from HTTP to HTTPS.

### January 28, 2016

API Functionality and Technical Documentation

The OpenX Platform API now supports enhanced API functionality for forecasting and legacy SRS reporting. UI functionality remains unchanged for both of these features, however, users will be able to access forecasting and reporting features via the OpenX Platform API, as well as detailed technical documentation describing how to use these features in the API Developer's Guide.

#### Forecasting

Users may now run forecasts using the OpenX Platform API. Users wil still be able to use this feature via the user interface; however, if you choose to use the OpenX Platform API, you only need to make a single ```POST``` call to run a forecast.

For more detailed information about forecasting via the OpenX Platform API, please see the Forecasting documentation.

#### Reporting

With this release, you may generate three different reports using the Platform API. You will still be able to access and generate these reports via the user interface, but you will now also be able to generate these reports via the Platform API. The three type of reports you can generate using the Platform API are:

* Bid Performance Report
* Exchange Report
* SSP Revenue Report

Please see the Reporting documentation for more detailed information on how to use the OpenX Platform API for reporting.

### November 9, 2015

#### Comments

The OpenX API now supports adding, editing, and retrieving comments using the OpenX API. With the OpenX API, you can:

* Add a new comment to an object
* Edit your own comments
* Retrieve a list of comments for an object

Comments can be used to add notes to objects (e.g. line items, creatives, etc.) for other users to see; however, users will not be notified about new comments. Furthermore, one can only view comments when in the edit mode of an object.

If you are using the API to add/edit a comment, the following objects can have comments applied: ```account, ad, adunit, adunitgroup, audiencesegment, creative, creativetemplate, lineitem, optimization, order, site, deal, floorrule```, and ```package```.

Refer to the Working With Comments section for more detailed information on using this feature.

#### Ad Request API
An ad tag is a small piece of code that defines the ad space where you want to display ads. When you place ad tags in your inventory, they send ad requests to OpenX, which sends delivery responses to serve ads to end users. Each ad tag includes parameters describing the inventory that advertising campaigns can target. You can customize ad requests to support your particular implementation and target certain types of ads.

The OpenX Ad Request API supports the following types of ad requests:

* Email. An image-only email ad request that supports server-side tracking
* iframe. HTML iframe tags (<iframe>) used to request an ad (within a separate HTML document) for a specified ad unit
* Image. HTML anchor (<a>) and image (<img>) tags used to request ads for a specified ad unit
* JavaScript. JavaScript used to request ads for individual ad units, multi-ad units, and ad unit groups
* Mobile. Returns a structured delivery response used to serve ads in your mobile app or site
* Server-to-server. A custom implementation where you proxy ad requests from the client to a third-party system, which then makes calls to OpenX
* Structured response. Returns a response format used for integration with a custom application. You must configure your application to build the ad request URL, make the call, and parse the response.
* Video. Send a video ad request to OpenX through your video player and receive a VAST 2.0 XML response for video-based ad inventory. You must configure your video player to communicate the contents of the video ad request URL.

Depending on your ad space, you can implement more than one type of ad tag. For example, if you want to display three ad units on a webpage, you could implement an image tag, an iframe tag, and a JavaScript tag.

For individual ad units ("standalone") or ad unit group requests, you can typically generate ad tags through the OpenX UI. Use JavaScript ad tags for multi-ad unit requests as well as standalone and ad unit group requests.

Note: These topics assume that you are a software developer with an understanding of ad serving and that you know how to configure your ad space to make calls to external services.

#### Ad request parameters

OpenX uses parameter values (also known as "query args") during ad selection to target the most appropriate ads to your ad space. Depending on the type of ad request, OpenX may do one of the following:

* Ignore parameters that are not applicable to the type of ad request. For example, the VMaxd video ad request parameter is ignored if included in an image ad request.
* Return an error if one or more parameters are not valid for the ad request.

You can set parameters for your ad requests by including key-value pairs: key=value For example, auid=1234 specifies the ad unit ID, which is required in all standalone ad requests.

The following table describes the parameters that OpenX supports in its ad requests. Depending on the type of ad request that you are using, some of the parameters are required, while others are optional. Unless described as required, all parameters are optional (if applicable to the type of ad request) or ignored (when not applicable).

Note: The OpenX JavaScript Tag Library does not support all of the following parameters. For information about what parameters each method supports, see the corresponding reference page for the specific method.

Parameter |	Description |
--------- |    ------------ |
auid |	(Required) Ad unit ID, indicates the unique ID for the ad unit where you want to serve an ad. |
aus |	Ad unit sizes, indicates a comma-delimited list of available ad sizes, such as aus=728x90,970x90. To use this parameter, you must include additional ad unit sizes when you create your ad unit. For details, see flexible ad units. |
c.key=value |	Custom variable, communicates additional information about the ad space, such as details of webpage content, ad space location, or user-specific information. |
callback |	Indicates the JavaScript function call with which to wrap the JSON structure using JSON with padding (JSONP) standards
Required only for JSONP responses to /arj (JSONP) and /avj (video JSONP) requests. |
cb |	Cache busting, a dynamically-generated random number assigned to the request to avoid browser caching. If you generate an HTML ad tag in the UI, OpenX includes the cb parameter in the ad tag as follows: cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE. When implementing image and iFrame ad tags for HTML ad requests, replace the INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE value with a random number, such as a timestamp or a number automatically generated by your CMS. If a user requests the same page again, the browser will invoke a new ad request rather than serving an ad from the cache. |
ch |	Character encoding, indicates the character set for the current webpage. |
cs |	Client state, indicates a unique ID for the ad unit and user to communicate between the click URL and the ad. This parameter is required for image ad tags and ignored for all other types of ad requests. This parameter only accepts values which use the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ (underscore), or - (hyphen). |
lt | Publishers should send 1, 2, or 3 for the lt parameter (1 is preferred) with lat/lon. If lat/lon is passed with 5 or more decimal places instead of lt. this value is treated the same as lt=1. |
ltsrc deprecated. | Indicates the source of the user’s geographic location details. If the ltsrc parameter has any value, the latitude and longitude is considered to have been derived from the device's GPS location. Otherwise, the latitude and longitude was derived from an IP address. [deprecated] |
mimetype | The mimetype of the mobile video ad unit, which can be any of the following:
* Android: video/3gp, video/mp4
* iOS: video/3gp, video/mov, video/mp4, video/mpv
This parameter is required by mobile video ad requests and is ignored by other types of ad requests. |
o | Indicates a random number assigned to the request that helps scope the response from the server. This ensures that multiple server responses do not collide. This is useful if you are writing your own synchronous JavaScript ad tags and do not use the OpenX JavaScript tag library. For example, if you are building your own tag library, sending OpenX the required inputs, and parsing its output. This parameter is optional for JavaScript ad tags, mobile video ad requests, and video ad requests. It is ignored by other types of ad requests. |
openrtb	| Specifies a string with supply-side OpenRTB data to be passed to OpenX Ad Exchange buyers. |
pgid | Page ID, indicates the unique ID for the predefined ad unit group. This parameter is optional for JavaScript ad tags, mobile video ad requests, and video ad requests. Note: Do not specify this parameter for iFrame or image ad requests, because it will cause an error. |
plg | Plugins, indicates any plugins enabled in the user's browser, such as:
* pdf. Adobe Acrobat Reader
* qt. QuickTime
* rp. Real Media Player
* shk. Adobe Shockwave
* sl. Silverlight
* swf. Flash
* wmp. Windows Media Player |
r, r0, r1, or r2 | Redirect, indicates the click redirect URL:
* r is a single-escaped URL. For example: http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clickredirectURL.com%3Fsome%3D1%26others%3D2F
* r0 is an unescaped URL. For example: http://www.clickredirectURL.com?some=1&others=2 
* r1 is a single-escaped URL (same as r).
* r2 is a double-escaped URL. For example: http%253A%252F%252Fwww.clickredirectURL.com%253Fsome%253D1%2526others%253D2. Note: Any of these redirect parameters must be the last parameter in an ad request URL or click URL string. |
rc | Refresh count, indicates the current number of refreshes for ads served through the ad tag, as counted by OpenX
This parameter is not initially set in the ad tag. For image, iFrame, JavaScript, and video ad requests, OpenX adds it and then automatically sets it with each refresh. See also: structured response. For custom implementations, your client application adds it and then sets it with each refresh. |
rd | Refresh delay (in seconds) for refreshing an iFrame. This value must be an integer ≥ 1. If you explicitly pass this parameter in an ad tag, OpenX ignores any server-side refresh delay setting for this ad unit (as set when creating or editing the ad unit or its container site). |
ref | Referrer, indicates the URL that directed the user to the current webpage. Setting this parameter overrides any referrer information passed in the HTTP headers. |
res | Resolution, indicates the screen resolution of the user's browser (screen width x height x color depth). |
rm | Refresh max, indicates the maximum number of refreshes for ads displayed through the ad tag. This must be a positive integer. For example, setting this parameter to a value of 5 would result in the display of a total of 6 ads (which includes the initial display of the ad (non-refresh) and the 5 subsequent displays of the ad (refreshes). If you explicitly pass this parameter in an ad tag, OpenX ignores any server-side refresh max setting for this ad unit (as set when creating or editing the ad unit or its container site).
This optional parameter only applies to iFrame tags, JavaScript tags, and structured ad responses. |
tfcd | Query argument that enables Child's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) regulations.
Possible values: 0 and 1.
* 0=COPPA regulations not enabled.
* 1=COPPA regulations enabled.
Refer to OpenRTB 2.3, section 7.1 for more detailed information on COPPA compliance and regulations. |
tg | Click target, indicates the browser window target when a user clicks an ad on the webpage
This can be one of the following:
* _blank. New window
* _parent Parent window
* _self. Current window
* _top. Top window
Note: This parameter is only used for image and flash creatives that display in iFrame and JavaScript ad tags. |
tid | Topic ID, indicates the content topic for the webpage. |
tz | Timezone, indicates the time zone of the user's web browser. |
VBw | Video bandwidth, indicates the maximum bandwidth for the video ad, in bits per second. Use this parameter as an override for the ad unit setting. |
VHt | Video height, indicates the expected height dimension of the video ad, in pixels. Use this as an override for the ad unit setting. |
VMaxd | Video maximum duration, indicates the maximum length of the video ad, in seconds. Use this as an override for the ad unit. setting. This parameter is required for mobile video ad requests. |
VPl | Video player, indicates the abbreviation for the VAST 2.0-compliant video player that you are using to display the ad, which can be WMV, FLV, or RA. Use this as an override for the ad unit setting. |
Vstrm | Video streaming protocol, indicates the streaming protocol to use for the video ad. Use this as an override for the ad unit setting.
VWd | Video width, indicates the expected width dimension for the video ad, in pixels. Use this as an override for the ad unit setting. |
xid | User ID, indicates the customer-provided user ID. |

The following types of ad request have their own parameters:

* Mobile ad request parameters
* Supply-side OpenRTB parameters

In addition, there are some parameters specific to certain OX instance and OX static methods.
Refer to the topics for each type of ad request for more information about how to incorporate these parameters in your specific ad requests.

If you are performing HTML ad requests with image, iFrame, or JavaScript ad tags, you may be able to specify various HTML attributes that are specific to the tag type that you are using. For example, for an image ad tag, this may include the border attribute. This guide does not go into detail about how to use common HTML attributes. For more information, refer to www.w3schools.com.

Note: In cases where a web browser is used to make an ad request, the browser may truncate the an ad request if the resulting URL exceeds its character limits. These limits vary by browser, but consider this by setting required parameters first and then incorporating optional parameters in your tags.

## Custom variables in ad requests

You can include custom variables to provide additional information about your ad space if available ad request parameters do not meet your needs. Each custom variable is expressed as a key-value pair (KVP) and must meet the following requirements:

* To distinguish it from other types of ad request parameters, custom KVPs must be prefixed with the c. namespace. For example: c.topic=sports (where topic is the key and sports is the value).
* Expressed using the following characters: a-z, 0-9, _ (underscore), or . (period). If you need to use reserved characters in your values, you can use percent-encoding (express them as a pair of hexadecimal digits derived from the character's ASCII byte value and prefixed with %). For example, to include an exclamation point (!), use %21 instead. Note: Uppercase letters in KVPs do not result in an error, but OpenX converts them to lowercase values. Therefore, only KVPs passed as lowercase characters will match line item targeting—even if entered with uppercase letters via the UI.
* Multiple values for a single key must be separated by a comma (,). For example: c.age=30,40,50. Alternatively, specify multiple instances, such as: c.age=30&c.age=40&c.age=50
* Multiple KVPs must be separated by an ampersand (&). For example: c.gender=m&c.age=40&c.topic=sports
* Keys are limited to 20 characters.
* Values are limited to 255 characters for each value. For multiple values of a single key, the sum of all of the values cannot exceed the 255 characters.
* To include a custom variable in JavaScript ad tags, use the addVariable method before the fetchAds or requestAd methods.
* If you use a standalone JavaScript tag format, you must pass in a vars object in the JSON structure to include custom KVPs in the ad tag. For example: "vars":{"key1":"value1"," key2":"value2"}

## OpenRTB supply-side ad request parameter values

To better characterize your inventory, you can send additional data about your ad units to buyers in the OpenX Ad Exchange using OpenRTB 2.3 values. You do not need to pass all OpenRTB values because OpenX automatically identifies and passes many of them for you.

The openrtb ad request parameter supports a percent-encoded string generated from JSON objects with supported OpenRTB values.
Sample openrtb parameter included in an ad request:

The following ad request shows how you can include various ad request parameters—including the openrtb parameter, which specifies a percent-encoded string.

To improve performance, remove all unneeded white space and line breaks from your JSON object before generating a percent-encoded version of it as shown in the following example.

JSON string prepared for percent-encoding:
```
{"cur": ["USD"], "site": {"publisher": {"domain": "example.com", "cat": ["IAB3-1"], "id": "8953", "name": "example.com"}, "domain":

Email ad requests
Serving ads in HTML-based email messages and newsletters is unique because most email clients only support static image tags and do not reliably support the following:
Cookies
Iframe tags
JavaScript tags
To support ad serving in this unique environment, OpenX:
Provides an Email Banner ad unit type, which is designed for classifying ad space in email messages.
Supports a special image-only email ad tag, which relies on server-side storage to track users rather than cookies. Because client-side cookie support in email messages is unlikely, OpenX cannot uniquely identify each user who either views or clicks an ad without a unique code for each recipient.
Email image ad tags are very similar to web image ad tags except for the following:
/e. Indicates the Email Banner delivery medium rather than /w for Web or /mw for Mobile web
cs (required). The client state parameter indicates a unique ID. You need a separate cs value for each recipient.
You can generate unique IDs via your content management system (CMS) and set these values in the cs parameter of the click and ad request URLs. The cs value must be the same for a single user's click and ad request URLs, but should be unique for each ad unit and each user. For example, if you place two image ad tags in a newsletter, and send it to 100 people, you must generate 200 unique codes for the cs parameter and implement your ad tags in the source code of your email messages or newsletters.
To implement email ads in OpenX
Use your email vendor's tools to create an HTML-based message including areas where you plan to show ads. Plain-text messages do not support dynamic ad serving.
Classify your email ad space in OpenX, which includes defining ad units as email inventory and setting targetable attributes. For example, if you have three places in your message where you want to show ads, define an Email Banner ad unit for each one.
Implement each email ad tag with the appropriate parameter in the message source code between <body> tags in the locations where you want ads to display.
Important: Do not simply copy and paste an email ad tag without setting parameters for it. You must configure a unique cs parameter value for each email banner ad unit and for each recipient.
Send the message to your recipients.
When an end-user opens the message, their email client renders the HTML and sends an ad request to OpenX to load images.
OpenX performs ad selection and serves the appropriate ad.
OpenX stores the relevant transaction information using the value of the cs parameter in the ad request to facilitate potential clicks.
When the end-user clicks on the ad in the message, OpenX uses the cs parameter in the click URL to access the relevant transaction information from the request.
The user is directed to the appropriate landing page and the click is attributed to the appropriate ad.
Sample email ad tag implementation
<html>
<head></head>
<body>

Some content here

Ad goes here

<a href="http://delivery_server_domain/e/1.0
/rc?cs=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"
target="_blank">
<img src="http://delivery_server_domain/e/1.0
/ai?auid=8&cs=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"
border="0" alt=""></a>

Some other content here

Another ad goes here

<a href="http://delivery_server_domain/e/1.0
/rc?cs=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"
target="_blank">
<img src="http://delivery_server_domain/e/1.0
/ai?auid=8&cs=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"
border="0" alt=""></a>

</body>
</html>
Each email ad tag contains the following:
Click URL. A URL used to track clicks and redirect the user to the appropriate landing page
For example: <a href="http://delivery_server_domain/e/1.0/rc?cs=4cbf34e0354e7 target="_blank">
Where:
/e. The email delivery medium
/1.0. Version 1.0 of the OpenX ad serving protocol.
/rc. The record click action for click tracking
?. Separates the click URL from ad request parameters
cs. Specifies a unique identifier, which ties together the click request and the ad request
Ad request URL. References the email banner ad unit for which to serve an ad when the end-user opens the message
For example: <img src="http://delivery_server_domain/e/1.0/ai?auid=8&cs=4cbf34e0354e7 border="0" alt=""></a>
Where:
/ai. A request to serve an ad through an image tag
auid. The ad unit ID
Ampersand (&). Separates each parameter
Ad request parameters (optional). Provide additional information to OpenX Ad Server. For example, you may want to include the xid parameter to assign your own unique ID for each user to which you send the email message. You can also include custom variables in your email ad tags, such as message content or version.

iFrame ad tags
An <iframe> ad tag represents an inline frame within your webpage allowing you to position ads on the window without impacting the rest of the page layout.
When a user browses to a webpage where you have implemented OpenX iframe ad tags:
The browser invokes an ad request for the ad unit referenced in the URL for the src attribute of the HTML iframe tag.
OpenX receives the request, performs ad selection, and returns an HTML document with the embedded ad content.
The browser renders the ad in the appropriate ad space.
If the user's browser does not support iframes, it can use an image tag instead. For iframe ad tags that you generate through the OpenX UI, an optional image tag fallback mechanism is provided by default. You can place include other tag types between the iframe tags (<iframe>fallback tag here</iframe>) and they will be ignored if the iframe is supported by the user's browser.
Iframe ad tags employ a client-side counting mechanism: they log an impression after the ad is rendered by the browser.
Iframe tags have the following advantages:
Auto-refresh via ad request parameters
Fallback tags can be included in case the user's browser does not support iframes.
Parallel execution, which minimizes page-load times
You can hide source page information from downstream ad servers, such as the page and referring URLs.
Content styles are not influenced by the parent page CSS, so the ad in the iframe does not have to match the style of the rest of the page.
Limitations associated with iframe tags include:
Each iframe tag is a standalone request for a single ad unit—they do not support ad unit group or multi-ad unit requests. To fulfill multiple ad units on the same webpage, you can implement an iframe tag for each ad unit you want to serve.
Multiple ad units on a page using iframe tags cannot communicate with each other.
Iframe tags are not compatible with most contextual-analysis networks.
To display ads that expand outside the dimensions of an iframe window, you must implement an iframe-buster.

### iFrame ad tag structure
An iframe ad tag contains HTML tags and various parameters.
Sample iframe ad tag
<iframe id='a62ae7d3' name='a62ae7d3'
src='http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/afr?auid=
8635&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&rd=5&rm=3"
frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='728'
height='90'>

<a href='http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/rc?cs=
acd22faf&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"
target='_blank'>
<img src='http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0
/ai?uid=8635&cs=acd22faf&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"
border='0' alt='' /></a></iframe>
This ad tag contains the following components:
Ad request URL. Defines the iframe element, references the ad unit ID, and includes various ad request parameters.
<iframe id='a62ae7d3' name='a62ae7d3'
src='http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/afr?auid=8635&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&rd=5&rm=3'
frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='728'
height='90'>
Where:
http is the protocol. If your ad space uses SSL/TLS, specify https instead.
delivery_server_domain. The hostname of the OpenX delivery server
/w. Indicates the web delivery medium
/1.0. Indicates version 1.0 of the OpenX iframe tag protocol
/afr. Indicates the request to serve an ad through an iframe ad tag
The . Separates the ad request from the ad tag parameters
auid. The ad unit ID
&. Separates each additional ad request parameter.
cb. Specifies a cachebusting setting
rd. Enables auto-refresh for the ad tag
rm. The maximum number of refreshes
Fallback mechanism. If the browser does not support iframes, OpenX uses an image ad tag to fulfill the request:
<a href='http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/rc?cs=acd22faf&
cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'>
<img src='http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/ai?auid=8635&
cs=acd22faf&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a>
The parameter values that you select for the ad request URL and its fallback tags ultimately determine what ads are displayed for the ad unit.
You can also include custom variables in your iframe ad tags. For example, the URL for an iframe tag with custom variables for the user's gender, age, and keywords might look like the following:
http://d.example.com/w/1.0/ai?
auid=1234&cs=xyz&c.gender=m&c.age=40&c.keyword=coupons
To implement iframe ad tags:
Generate your iframe ad tag via the OpenX UI.
Copy the iframe ad tag.
Paste the ad tag in the website source code between the HTML body tags where you want the ad to display.
Sample iframe ad tag implementation
<html>
<head></head>

<body>

<!-- if the iframe doesn't work, serve an image tag. -->

<iframe id='a62ae7d3' name='a62ae7d3' 
src='http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/afr?auid=
8635&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&rd=5&rm=3"
frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='728' 
height='90'>

<a href='http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/rc?cs=

acd22faf&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"
border='0' alt='' /></a></iframe>

Replace the value of the cb parameter with a random number (preferably a dynamically auto-generated number from your CMS) for cachebusting purposes.

## JavaScript ad tags
You can add JavaScript tags (<script>) to an HTML ad request to:
Define ad units.
Select and queue appropriate ads for the ad units.
Display the selected ads in the appropriate ad space.
Provide dual-fallback: an iframe tag fallback if a browser has JavaScript disabled and an image tag if both JavaScript and iframes are disabled.
Automatically detect various parameters, such as the user's screen resolution, which ad traffickers can target.
Specify standalone, ad unit group, and multi-ad unit requests.
Use a client-side impression counting mechanism.
Note: While flexible, JavaScript tags are unforgiving if the resulting ad has bad syntax or formatting, which can negatively impact page rendering and layout.
OpenX provides the following JavaScript tools to support customizable ad requests:
Asynchronous JavaScript tags. Runs in parallel with the execution of the page to deliver ads to a specified ad unit.
Synchronous JavaScript tags. Runs in series with the execution of the page loading to deliver ads to a specified ad unit.
OpenX JavaScript tag library. Supports customized ad requests and simplifies how parameter values are sent to the Ad Server. For example, you can use tag library methods to override certain parameters, specify fallback ads, and set third-party impression beacons for your JavaScript ad tags. The tag library is a small file downloaded to the user's browser from the following path on your delivery server: http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/jstag
The jstag file provides the following JavaScript methods:
Instance methods. Set distinct configuration or ad request parameters for a given instantiation of an OX object.
Static methods. Set global configuration values and manage global data sets in the OpenX JavaScript tag library.
Note: The OpenX JavaScript Tag Library does not support all ad request parameters. For information about what parameters each method supports, see the corresponding reference page for the specific method.
You can implement the following types of JavaScript tags:
Standalone. Request a single ad inline. OpenX supports three formats for standalone JavaScript ad tags:
Generated in the UI. Works in standard and third-party trafficking implementations. Stores ad request details in an OX_ads global array and uses OX_ads.push to add a new ad unit to the ad request queue. Use this method if you are sending the ad tag to a third-party to traffic in another ad server or for ad tags wrapped in a document.write() call.
Static method format. Uses the requestAd method to invoke an ad request and show the selected ad.
Instance method format. Uses OX instance methods to set up tag attributes, invoke the ad request, and display the appropriate ad.
Ad unit group. Request ads for multiple ad units referenced in a single call by an ad unit group ID (pgid). This type of request is required for companion ad placement. You must use the OpenX UI or API to create ad unit groups.
Multi-ad unit. Requests ads for multiple ad units in a single call and facilitate coordination between ad units (e.g., competitive exclusion).

### Implementing standalone ad tags
Regardless of the standalone ad tag implementation that you use (that is, using static methods, using instance methods, or for tags running on another server), the way that you include the ad tag in your website source code is the same.
To implement a standalone ad tag:
Generate your ad tag in the OpenX UI, via the OpenX API, or manually using the information in this help section.
Copy the ad tag.
Paste the ad tag in your website source code. You need to paste your ad tag between the HTML body tags, where you want the ad to display.
The JavaScript request structure must:
Include the method and required parameters
Contain only one method (send a separate request for each operation you want to perform)
Include the full case-sensitive method name using the following pattern: OBJECT_NAME.method_name.
For example, to request an ad for an ad unit, call the addAdUnit method using the following format: OX_random_string.addAdUnit(auid)
(Optional) OpenX provides a parameter for JavaScript tags to avoid potential namespace collisions.
ClosedStandalone synchronous JavaScript ad tag
 ClosedStandalone ad tag implementation using requestAd method
ClosedAsynchronous JavaScript ad tag implementation

### Avoiding namespace collisions
To avoid namespace collisions between the OX object (named OX) and other JavaScript objects with the same name, OpenX supports the oxns (OpenX namespace) parameter. For all tag implementations, you can manually add the oxns parameter to the request to fetch the tag library in your ad tag (<script src="http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/jstag"></script>). When implemented, OpenX renames the OpenX object with the value of the oxns parameter appended to OX_. For example, if your ad request passes the following request to load the tag library:
<script src="http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/jstag?oxns=mycompany"></script>
Then the name of the OX object changes to OX_mycompany. For all JavaScript tag implementations except standalone asynchronous or synchronous tags, you need to manually update all JavaScript references to OX with the new name. For example, you need to change references to OX.frameCreatives(true) to OX_mycompany.frameCreatives(true). In addition, if the JavaScript tag is linked multiple times on a page, you need to add the same oxns parameter to each one.
The oxns parameter is restricted to alphanumeric values, including a combination of letters, numbers, or the underscore character ( _ ). If the value is empty or contains illegal characters, the default OX is used.

### Asynchronous JavaScript ad tags
Using asynchronous JavaScript ad tags can decrease page load times because the webpage content loads at its own pace while ads fill in around it via separate processes.
To implement asynchronous JavaScript ad tags, build them using OX instance and static methods and then paste your ad tag between the HTML body tags in the location where you want an ad to be displayed.

### Synchronous JavaScript ad tags
Synchronous JavaScript ad tags run in series with the execution of the overall loading of a page when delivering an ad for an ad unit. They provide the following benefits:
Compatible with third-party tags that use document.write()
Allow render-time access to the browser document object model (DOM)
They are processed in a predictable sequence.
Standalone synchronous JavaScript ad tag
You can use the OpenX UI to generate tags, which is recommended if you want to use it with third-party ad servers or any time an OpenX JavaScript ad tag is wrapped in a document.write() call.
<script type="text/javascript">
if (!window.OX_ads) OX_ads = [];
OX_ads.push({"auid":"4" });
</script>
<script src="http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/jstag"></script>
OpenWhere:
OX_ads. A global array to store ad request details
OX_ads.push. Adds a new ad unit to the ad request queue
({"auid":"4"}). Ad unit ID of the ad to be retrieved
src="http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/jstag. A request to fetch the OpenX JavaScript tag library
The OpenX JavaScript tag library scans the OX_ads array and executes ad requests via the public requestAd method.
Tip: To avoid namespace collisions, you can add the oxns parameter to this request. However, you do not need to manually change the references to the object on the page.
Standalone synchronous JavaScript tag with multiple parameters
The parameters in the following tag are supported by the requestAd method.
<script type="text/javascript">
if (!window.OX_ads) OX_ads = [];
OX_ads.push({
"auid":"12345",
"tid":"4",
"tg":"_blank",

OX_aa07b157.showAdUnit("12345");. Displays the selected ad for the ad unit with ID 12345
Multi-ad unit synchronous JavaScript tags
In cases where coordination is required between ad units (e.g., competitive exclusion) or if you want to reduce the number of calls made per page, you can use multi-ad unit tags.
To implement a multi-ad unit request in your website source code:
Paste the header tag in the header before the anchor tags.
Paste the anchor tags between the HTML body tags where you want to ads to be displayed. Failure to implement the appropriate anchor tags may result in a discrepancy between the number of requests and impressions you see in your delivery reports.

Ad unit group tags are designed to facilitate ad coordination and reduce page load times. You must use this type of tag to enable companion ad selection.
Use the OpenX UI to generate one header tag and an anchor tags for each ad unit referenced by the ad unit group; then customize them as needed.
Paste the header tag before the anchor tags in the header portion of your website source code and place each anchor tag between the body tags in the locations where you want to display ads.

### OX instance methods
An OX instance manages the ad request for a subset of ad units on a web page and is created by calling OX().
Use OX instance methods to set distinct configuration or ad request parameters for a given instantiation of an OX object. You can create multiple instances of an OX object in a single page view.
When building your JavaScript tags, determine the location in the source code of your ad space where specific methods must be placed and the order in which they must be called. For example, you must use the addAdUnit method before the fetchAds method, so you might place addAdUnit in the header of a webpage and fetchAds in the body.
Use a constructor to create a new OX object, which is assigned to a local variable. To protect against global namespace collisions, the OpenX tag generator creates a variable that has a random string appended to its name. For example, var OX_string = OX();.
The following OX instance methods are all void operations (they return an empty response with no data).

#### addAdUnit
Use this method to tell the tag library to fetch an ad for the specified ad unit when the fetchAds method is called.
You can call this method multiple times using the same or different ad unit IDs (e.g., for a multi-ad unit request).
If you call this method multiple times, ads are requested for each ad unit specified. If you specify the same ad unit multiple times, multiple ads are requested for the same ad unit.
addAdUnit parameters
Parameter	Description	Required?
auid	The ID for the ad unit that you want to request an ad for	Yes
addAdUnit Example
OX_string.addAdUnit("auid");
Where:
12345 is a random string.
auid is the ad unit ID.

#### addContentTopic
Use this method to indicate the ID of the node in the predefined content topic taxonomy that matches the content in the current page view. Frequently, it may be implemented dynamically by a content management system. The ID is included with each ad request made from the instance of the OX object, as the tid parameter.
You need to call this method before the fetchAds method is called.
addContentTopic parameters
Parameter	Description	Required?
topic_ID	The ID for the content topic of the current page	Yes
addContentTopicExample
OX_string.addContentTopic("51")
Where:
51 is the node ID for the content topic of the current page.

#### addOpenRTBParameter
This method adds OpenRTB data to the ad request so that it can be passed to buyers in the OpenX Ad Exchange.
Specify OpenRTB values as a key path, such as app.ver, where app represents the App object of the BidRequest and ver is an App object field representing the version of the mobile app.
You must pass this method before the fetchAds and load methods.
addOpenRTBParameter parameters
Parameters	Description	Required?
key	The OpenRTB JSON key path	Yes
value	The OpenRTB value	Yes
addOpenRTBParameter Example
OX_string.addOpenRTBParameter("imp[0].banner.w", 320);
OX_string.addOpenRTBParameter("imp[0].banner.h", 50);
OX_string.addOpenRTBParameter("app.ver", "1.0");
OX_string.addOpenRTBParameter("app.paid", 0);
OX_string.addOpenRTBParameter("app.keywords", "games");
Where:
string. A random string
"imp[0].banner.w", 320. The path to the Imp object's w field, which expresses the width of the ad unit in pixels
"imp[0].banner.h", 50. The path to the Imp object's h field, which expresses the height of the ad unit in pixels
"app.ver", "1.0". The path to the App object's ver field, which provides the mobile app's version string
"app.paid", 0. The path to the App object's paid field, where 0 means the app is free and 1 means the app is a paid version
"app.keywords", "games". The path to the App object's keywords field, which provides a comma-delimited list of keywords for the app

#### addDeviceID
Add a device ID for the user's device. This method can be called multiple times to add as many device IDs as are supported by the device.
addDeviceID parameters

deviceIDs	
A unique device identifier (UDID) object, which can include any of the following:
type. The type of device ID, which supports the following strings:
adid. Google advertising ID
ai.md5. An MD5 hash of the Android ID
ai.sha1. An SHA-1 hash of the Android ID
ia. Apple IDFA or IFA
ma.md5. An MD5 hash of the media access control (MAC) address
ma.sha1. An SHA-1 hash of the MAC address
o1. Open device identification number (ODIN-1)

OX_12345.addDeviceID({
    "type":"ia",
    "id":"43043FE3-6BA9-4515-8209-6E0AC6AE1ADF",
    "tracking":"true"
});
OX_12345.addDeviceID({
    "type":"oi",
    "id":"7a5fab3d942494f7e31be4f4eec0e8156f53c6bf"
});
requestAd setting deviceIDs
Alternatively, you can use a standalone JavaScript ad tag to set device IDs:
OX.requestAd({
    "auid": "12345",
    "deviceIDs": [
        {
            "type":"ia",
            "id":"43043FE3-6BA9-4515-8209-6E0AC6AE1ADF",
            "tracking":"true"
        },
        {
            "type":"oi",
            "id":"7a5fab3d942494f7e31be4f4eec0e8156f53c6bf"
        }
    ]
});

#### addPage
This method is similar to the addAdUnit method, but instead of queuing a request for a single ad unit, it queues a request for all of the ad units referenced by the predefined ad unit group via its pgid (page ID) value.
The addPage method tells the OpenX JavaScript tag library to fetch ads for all of the ad units in the specified ad unit group when the fetchAds (for synchronous tags) or load method (for asynchronous tags) is called.
You can call addAdUnit multiple times to fetch ads for multiple ad units for a given pgid.
This method does not actually fetch ads; it queues a pgid to fetch ads for when fetchAds or load is finally called.
addPage Parameters
Parameter	Description	Required?
pgid	The ID for the predefined ad unit group that you want to request ads for.	Yes
addPage Example
OX_12345.addPage("123");
Where:
123 is the pgid for the predefined ad unit group that you want to request ads for.

#### addVariable
Use this method to add a custom variable to the ad requests that come from the OX object instance.
You must pass this method before the fetchAds method.
addVariable parameters
Parameter	Description	Required?
key, value	The custom variable KVP	Yes
Set a custom variable
A request to set a custom variable for the user's gender might look like the following:
OX_12345.addVariable("gender","male");
Where:
gender. The custom key
male. The custom value
addVariable in a standalone tag
A standalone synchronous JavaScript ad tag with the addVariable method might look like the following:
<script type="text/javascript"
src="http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/jstag">
</script>

<script>
var OX_4d6552943f5a4 = OX();
OX_4d6552943f5a4.addAdUnit("54321");
OX_4d6552943f5a4.addVariable("gender", "male");
OX_4d6552943f5a4.fetchAds(); 
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
OX_4d6552943f5a4.showAdUnit("54321");
</script>
Where:
src="http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/jstag. A request to fetch the OpenX JavaScript tag library
var OX_4d6552943f5a4 = OX();. Create a new OX object and assign it to a global variable with a pseudo-random name.
.>OX_string. A variable, which is included in some tags by the OpenX tag generator. You should replace this string with an identifier of your choosing.
OX_4d6552943f5a4.addVariable("gender","male");. The addVariable method specifying a custom KVP
OX_4d6552943f5a4.fetchAds();. The fetchAds method, which must be passed after addVariable
OX_4d6552943f5a4.showAdUnit("54321");. The showAdUnit method, which shows the ads returned to the fetchAds method
Set multiple custom variables
You can set custom variables for an ad unit group request or a multi-ad unit request ad tag. To do this, repeat the addVariable method for each custom variable you want to set for the request. For example, to set custom variables for an ad unit group request ad tag (in this case, gender, age, and keyword), your request might look like the following:
...
OX_random_string.addVariable("gender","f");
OX_variable_string.addVariable("age","40");
OX_variable_string.addVariable("keyword","coupon");
...
Ad unit group request
The header portion of an ad unit group request (using the addPage method) ad tag might look like the following:
<script type="text/javascript"
src="http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/jstag">
</script> 

<script type="text/javascript">
var OX_12345 = OX();
OX_string.addPage("3");
OX_string.addVariable("gender","f");
OX_string.addVariable("age","40");
OX_string.addVariable("keyword","coupon");
OX_string.fetchAds(); 
</script>
Multi-ad unit request
A multi-ad unit request ad tag might look like the following:
<script src="http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/jstag">
</script>
 
<script>
var OX_12345 = OX();
OX_string.addAdUnit("54321");
OX_string.addAdUnit("98765");
OX_string.addVariable("gender","f");
OX_string.addVariable("age","40");
OX_string.addVariable("keyword","coupon");
OX_string.fetchAds();
</script>
Multiple values for the same custom variable
You can use this format to set multiple values for the same custom variable:
OX_string.addVariable("keyword","coupon,discount,rebate");

#### disableMarket
Use this method to disable market (OpenX Ad Exchange) for the ad request. This allows you to opt out of the Ad Exchange on a per-impression basis.
disableMarket Example
OX_string.disableMarket();

#### disableSegmentation
Use this method to disable audience segmentation for the ad request. This method sets the ns parameter of the requestAd method.
disableSegmentation Example
OX_string.disableSegmentation();

#### enableMarket
Use this method to enable market (OpenX Ad Exchange) for the ad request.
enableMarket Example
OX_string.enableMarket();

#### enableSegmentation
Use this method to enable audience segmentation for the ad request. This method sets the ns parameter of the requestAd method to null.
enableSegmentation Example
OX_string.enableSegmentation();

#### fetchAds
For synchronous JavaScript ad tags, use the this method to invoke an ad request to OpenX using all inputs from other methods. The ads returned from OpenX are not immediately displayed, but are stored by the OpenX JavaScript tag library for display later.
fetchAds Example
OX_string.fetchAds();

#### frameCreatives
Use this method to enable framing (true) or disable it (false) for all creatives of an OX object instance. If not set, it defaults to that set for the instance.
If set at both the page and instance levels, the OpenX JavaScript tag library uses the instance setting. This affects all ad units associated with the instance.
These settings are overridden by features that automatically add iframes, such as auto-refresh.
frameCreatives Example
OX_string.frameCreatives(true);

#### load
For asynchronous ad tags, use this method to invoke and ad request to OpenX and to display the selected ads using all of the inputs set via other methods.
Call this method after all of the placeholder elements have loaded for the webpage. That is, the script block that contains this call cannot go in <head>.
load Example
OX_string.load();

#### setAdUnitFallback
Use this method to set a fallback ad to serve for a specific ad unit, when OpenX has no ad to serve for an ad request.
For synchronous calls, you must call this method before showAdUnit. Otherwise, it will not work.
Note: Macro expansion is not supported in third-party fallback tags set in the ad tag.
setAdUnitFallback parameters
Parameter	Description	Required?
auid	The ad unit ID for the ad to be displayed	Yes
fallback	The HTML content to serve if the ad request returns an empty ad	Yes
setAdUnitFallback Example
OX_string.setAdUnitFallback("999999","<iframe src='http://www.mywebsite.com'></iframe>");

#### setAdUnitImpBeacon
Use this method to set a third-party impression beacon for the ad request. The third-party impression beacon is only triggered when OpenX delivers an actual ad (that is, not a fallback ad).
You cannot pass undefined as a value for the imp_beacon parameter for this method, so you cannot remove a third-party impression beacon after it is set.
For synchronous calls, you must call this method before showAdUnit. Otherwise, it will not work. Furthermore, macro expansion is not supported in third-party impression beacons set in the ad tag.
setAdUnitImpBeacon parameters
Parameter	Description	Required?
auid	The ad unit ID for the ad to be displayed	Yes
imp_beacon	The third-party impression beacon to set in the ad request	Yes
setAdUnitImpBeacon Example
OX_string.setAdUnitImpBeacon( "12345","<iframe src='example.com'></iframe>");

#### setAdUnitMarketFloor
Use this method to set the floor price for the specified ad unit using the aumf parameter of the ad request.
setAdUnitMarketFloor
Note: : The floor price must be in whole numbers (not float). For example, $1.25 floor price = 125.
Example

## Mobile ad requests
OpenX supports mobile ad serving in:
Mobile apps. Integrate with OpenX using the following approaches:
OpenX Mobile SDK.
Mobile ad request examples
Server-to-server ad requests
If you do not use the OpenX Mobile SDK, you must configure your app to interact with OpenX using the information contained in the ad request or by passing mobile parameters via JavaScript ad tags.
Mobile web. Similar to ad serving on desktop webpages because you can use image, iframe, and JavaScript ad tags by retrieving the ad tags and then pasting them in the source code for your mobile website.
After you set up your inventory components, you can retrieve the ad request URLs for your ad units through the Inventory tab or construct mobile ad requests.

### Mobile ad request parameters
Each mobile ad request contains query string parameters, which are essentially key-value pairs that used to target ads to your ad space. Depending on the type of ad request, some of these parameters are required (such as auid) and others are optional (such as custom variables).
You can include custom key-value pairs in your mobile ad requests. These custom variables may be based on elements such as webpage or app content, a user's registered location, or any other user-specific data. Typically, when you implement custom variables, you should add them to the end of your ad tag. This way, if the ad tag is truncated for any reason, the optional custom variables will be dropped instead of required parameters, such as the ad unit ID (auid).
All mobile ad requests must contain either the auid parameter, which specifies one or more ad units that you want to serve ads for, or the pgid parameter, which references the ad unit group to serve ads for. You can include additional parameters in your OpenX Ad Server mobile ad requests, including custom variables, so that OpenX Ad Server can more effectively target ads to your ad space.

rc	Refresh count. Once your client initiates a refresh, this indicates the current index in the refresh cycle. This parameter is not initially set in the ad request; however your client application adds it, and then sets it with each refresh.	No
rd	
Refresh delay (in seconds) for refreshing an iframe
This value must be an integer ≥ 1. If you explicitly pass this parameter in an ad tag, OpenX ignores any server-side refresh delay setting for this ad unit (as set when creating or editing the ad unit).
No
rm	
Refresh max, ndicates the maximum number of refreshes for ads displayed through the ad request
This value must be an integer ≥ 1. For example, setting this parameter to a value of 5 would result in the display of a total of 6 ads (which includes the initial display of the ad (non-refresh) and the 5 subsequent displays of the ad (refreshes). If you explicitly pass this parameter in an ad tag, OpenX Ad Server ignores any server-side refresh max setting for this ad unit, as set creating or editing the ad unit.
No
sp	Indicates the OpenX Mobile SDK platform (e.g., iOS or Android).	No
stt	
Indicates the end-user's state location.
For example: stt=california
No
sv	Indicates the version of the OpenX Mobile SDK (e.g., 3.1.0).	No
url	
Indicates the mobile app store URL or the mobile website URL.
The URL for mobile apps should not use an HTTPS URL; instead, use a corresponding HTTP URL. Non-app store mobile websites should use HTTPS URLs for secure sites.
For Apple it is the App Store URL. For example: url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/talking-tom-cat/id377194688?mt=8
For Android, it is the Google Play URL. For example: url=http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.outfit7.talkingtom&hl=en
Yes*
xid	
Indicates the customer-provided user ID, if different from the Device ID.
For example: xid=234hskhjfdkhjs
No
zip	
Indicates the US ZIP or postal code for the end-user.
For example: zip=93222
No
Parameters marked with an asterisk (*) in the Required? column must be present for OpenX Ad Exchange transactions.
The double asterisk (**) in the Required? column indicates that at least one of the parameters must be present for OpenX Ad Exchange transactions.
Tip:
Only some of parameters are specific to mobile ad serving. For more details, see ad request parameters.
OpenRTB ad request parameters allow you to pass OpenRTB data about your mobile inventory
OpenX can help pass third-party mobile data via third-party ad request parameters.

### OpenRTB mobile app use case
You can specify OpenRTB 2.3 field values to characterize your mobile app inventory and pass the values to OpenX Ad Exchange buyers.
The following code samples illustrate how to express your app data as a JSON object, combine it with other ad request parameters, prepare it for percent encoding, and then include it in an ad request.
To prepare OpenRTB values and include them in a mobile app ad request:
Prepare a JSON array of the OpenRTB values you want to pass to buyers via the openrtb parameter.
OpenRTB JSON:
{'app': {'bundle': 'com.example.wxapp',
         'cat': ['IAB15', 'IAB15-10'],
         'name': 'Example Inc',
         'storeurl': 'https://itunes.apple.com/id1234567890',
         'ver': '1.0.2'},
 'user': {'gender': 'M', 'yob': 1984}}
Where:
app. Corresponds to OpenRTB's App object. Its value includes the following fields:
bundle. The BidRequest.app.bundle field, which specifies the unique ID of the app's package (Android), bundle (iOS), or its AppStore ID
cat. The BidRequest.app.cat field, which specifies a list of IAB content categories for the app
name. The BidRequest.app.name field, which specifies the name of the app
storeurl. The BidRequest.app.storeurl field, which specifies the app store URL for the app
ver. The BidRequest.app.ver field, which specifies the version of the app
user. Corresponds to OpenRTB's User object. Its value includes the following fields:
gender. The BidRequest.user.gender field, where M indicates that the user is male
yob. The BidRequest.user.yob field, which specifies the user's year of birth expressed as a four-digit number
Limit the length of the final percent-encoded string to improve the performance of the request by converting the array to a string with minimal white space and no line breaks.
OpenRTB JSON string:
{"app": {"storeurl": "https://itunes.apple.com/id1234567890", "ver": "1.0.2", "name": "Example Inc", "bundle": "com.example.wxapp", "cat": ["IAB15", "IAB15-10"]}, "user": {"gender": "M", "yob": 1984}}
Include the OpenRTB JSON string as the value of theopenrtb parameter along with other mobile ad request parameters. You should express your ad request parameters as key value pairs (KVPs), which you will then need to include in your percent-encoded string for inclusion in the ad request.
Array of KVPs:
  auid=1234567890
  af=3,5
  cnt=United States
  crr=310-260
  cty=LosAngeles
  dd=2.0
  did.adid=c5865179-ae0f-49a8-a7a6-02dff65b86f9
  did.adid.enabled=true
  lat=34.1496718
  lon=-118.1331111
  ltsrc=gps
  net=wifi
  openrtb={"app": {"storeurl": "https://itunes.apple.com/id1234567890", "ver": "1.0.2", "name": "Example Inc", "bundle": "com.example.wxapp", "cat": ["IAB15", "IAB15-10"]}, "user": {"gender": "M", "yob": 1984}}
  sp=Android
  stt:California
  sv:3.0
  zip:91101
Generate a percent-encoded string of all ad request parameters to be included in the ad tag that you will include in your mobile app.
Percent-encoded string of ad request parameters:
auid=1234567890&sp=Android&af=3%2C5&sv=3.0&cnt=United+States&zip=91101&lon=-118.1331111&net=wifi&did.adid.enabled=true&dd=2.0&ltsrc=gps&lat=34.1496718&crr=310-260&openrtb=%7B%22app%22%3A+%7B%22storeurl%22%3A+%22https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fid1234567890%22%2C+%22ver%22%3A+%221.0.2%22%2C+%22name%22%3A+%22Example+Inc%22%2C+%22bundle%22%3A+%22com.example.wxapp%22%2C+%22cat%22%3A+%5B%22IAB15%22%2C+%22IAB15-10%22%5D%7D%2C+%22user%22%3A+%7B%22gender%22%3A+%22M%22%2C+%22yob%22%3A+1984%7D%7D&cty=LosAngeles&stt=California&did.adid=c5865179-ae0f-49a8-a7a6-02dff65b86f9
Include the percent-encoded string of ad request parameters in an ad request.
Sample mobile ad request:
http://delivery_server_domain/ma/1.0/acj?auid=1234567890&sp=Android&af=3%2C5&sv=3.0&cnt=United+States&zip=91101&lon=-118.1331111&net=wifi&did.adid.enabled=true&dd=2.0&ltsrc=gps&lat=34.1496718&crr=310-260&openrtb=%7B%22app%22%3A+%7B%22storeurl%22%3A+%22https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fid1234567890%22%2C+%22ver%22%3A+%221.0.2%22%2C+%22name%22%3A+%22Example+Inc%22%2C+%22bundle%22%3A+%22com.example.wxapp%22%2C+%22cat%22%3A+%5B%22IAB15%22%2C+%22IAB15-10%22%5D%7D%2C+%22user%22%3A+%7B%22gender%22%3A+%22M%22%2C+%22yob%22%3A+1984%7D%7D&cty=LosAngeles&stt=California&did.adid=c5865179-ae0f-49a8-a7a6-02dff65b86f9
Where:
http is the protocol. If your ad space uses SSL/TLS, use https instead.
delivery_server_domain. The hostname of your OpenX delivery server
/ma. Indicates the mobile app delivery medium
/1.0. Indicates version 1.0 of the OpenX Supply API
/acj. Asynchronous chain JSON, an asynchronous ad request to serve a structured JSON delivery response which supports chaining
?. Separates the ad request from the ad request parameters
auid. (Required) The ad unit ID
&. Separates each parameter, which are described in the
openrtb=. Indicates the OpenRTB values
Tip: Some OpenRTB fields cannot be passed from publishers to OpenX Ad Exchange.
Do not include such fields because they will be ignored and will only increase the length of your request.

### Passing mobile parameters via JavaScript ad tags
Some ad servers do not provide macros for passing certain information, such as device and location data. OpenX can help you monetize if you pass the following types of information from your app to an OpenX JavaScript tag via your ad server's SDK:
Advertising ID
App bundle ID
App name
App store URL
Device ID
Location (latitude and longitude)
For example, you can pass parameters from custom apps by Android and iOS devices using the MoPub JavaScript tag integrations.

#### MoPub integration
Tip: This topic assumes that you have an OpenX Ad Exchange for Publishers account and a MoPub account.
You can create OpenX JavaScript ad tags to integrate with MoPub and pass various parameters from custom apps on Android and iOS devices.
You can include MoPub macros in OpenX ad tags to automatically capture user-specific parameters. However, you need to manually define inventory-specific parameters.
Sample JavaScript ad tag with MoPub macros
The following sample tag used with MoPub integrations shows a variety of manually-defined parameters and MoPub macros.
<!-- Begin OpenX Tag -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://delivery_server_domain/ma/1.0/jstag"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
(function(){
	var did = '%eudid!';
		ad = {
			auid: '[OpenX_AdUnitID]',
			appName: 'Client App Name',
			appBundle: 'com.clientname.appname',
			appStoreURL: 'http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/app_name/ID_number',
			coords: { 
				latitude: '%%LATITUDE%%', 
				longitude: '%%LONGITUDE%%' 
			},
			openrtb: {
				app: {
					publisher: {
						name: 'JS App Tag Publisher',
					},
					storeurl: 'http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/app_name/ID_number'
				},
			},
			fallback: '<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">loaded=true;window.location="mopub://failLoad";<\/script>'
		},
	
if(did){if(!!navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone|iPad/)){ad.deviceIDs=[{type:'ia',id:did}];}else if(!!navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/)){ad.deviceIDs=[{type:((!!did.match(/-/))?'adid':'ai.sha1'),id:did}];}}
OX.frameCreatives(false);
OX.requestAd(ad);
})();
</script>
Where:
src="http://delivery_server_domain/ma/1.0/jstag. A request by the mobile app (/ma) to fetch the OpenX JavaScript tag library
auid. (Required) The OpenX ad unit ID of the ad to be retrieved
appName. The display name of the mobile app
appBundle. The bundle (or "package") name of an app
appStoreURL. (Required) The app store URL for the app
coords. The GPS latitude and longitude of the end user, which are mapped to the %%LATITUDE%% and %%LONGITUDE%% MoPub macros
did = '%eudid!'. A MoPub ID macro used to combine the IDFA, SHA1 Hashed Android ID, or Android Advertising ID
fallback. A fallback used to send the request back to MoPub if OpenX does not fill the request
OX.frameCreatives. A call to the frameCreatives method to determine the default framing behavior for ads (false = disabled)
OX.requestAd. A call to the requestAd method that invokes an ad request
Once you have constructed the tag based on your needs, you can paste it into the HTML Body field of the MoPub UI, which is in the following location:
Order > Line Item > Creative

### Mobile ad request examples
You can use mobile ad requests to send an ad request URL and OpenX will send a structured delivery response in one of the following formats:
HTML (/arh). Returns a block of HTML for a single ad unit containing the proper impression- and click- tracking elements
JSON (/arj). Returns a JSON response for a single ad unit, an ad unit group, or multiple ad units in a single call
XML (/arx). Returns an XML response for a single ad unit, an ad unit group, or multiple ad units in a single call
To render ads appropriately in your mobile app or site, you must configure your app to interpret the response.
If no matching ads are available for a particular ad request, OpenX returns an empty response. You should test a few ad requests to review how OpenX represents objects in its responses and make sure that your app is configured handle them.
Each mobile ad request contains an ad request URL, which references the ad unit to deliver an ad for and various parameters. For example:
Sample HTML mobile ad request
http://delivery_server_domain/ma/1.0/arh?auid=6
Sample JSON mobile ad request
http://delivery_server_domain/ma/1.0/arj?auid=6
Sample XML mobile ad request
http://delivery_server_domain/ma/1.0/arx?auid=6
Where:
http. The protocol. If your app or mobile site uses SSL, use https.
delivery_server_domain. The hostname of your OpenX delivery server
/ma. Indicates the mobile app delivery medium. Alternatively: /mw indicates mobile web delivery.
/1.0. Indicates that OpenX should use version 1.0 of the OpenX HTML, XML, or JSON protocol.
/arh, /arx or /arj. Indicates the action to perform, such as a request to serve an HTML (/arh), XML (/arx), or JSON (/arj) delivery response.
?. Separates the ad request from the ad request parameters.
auid. The ad unit ID of the ad to be delivered. For a multi-ad unit request, include a comma-separated list of ad unit IDs. For an ad unit group request, include the pgid parameter with the ad unit group ID.
&. Separates each parameter.
HTTP header forwarding
To proxy ad or tracking request not sent directly from a mobile device to OpenX, one of the following HTTP headers must be forwarded to OpenX with the request:
Accept-Language
Host
Referer
User-Agent
X-Forwarded-For
Impression counting
To implement a client-side impression counting mechanism, your app must make a call to OpenX via an impression confirmation beacon, which is embedded in pre-formatted responses. If your app does the final formatting, you must ensure proper handling of the beacon. Work with your OpenX account manager to ensure proper integration.
Managing refresh
To use the refresh_delay and refresh_max fields to manage refresh, your client application must:
Identify the refresh_delay and refresh_max fields in the XML or JSON response.
Append rc=COUNT, where COUNT is replaced with the iteration of the reload (e.g., first refresh has rc=1 and third has rc=3).
For example:
max = response.refresh_max
delay = response.refresh_delay
for (i=1;i++;i<=refresh_max) {
  sleep(delay)
  url = build_url() + "&rc=" + i
  fetch_ad(url)
}

#### HTML response
A mobile /arh call returns a block of HTML code, ready to display in the mobile app, which contains the final ad creative, appropriate impression counting beacons, and proper click-tracking elements.

### Server-to-server ad calls

Typically, ad serving involves a client (such as a web browser or app) making requests directly to OpenX. A server-to-server ad call is an alternative implementation where you proxy ad requests: the client talks to an intermediate (third-party) system, which then makes calls to OpenX. This approach applies to any programmatic integrations, such as custom mobile device implementations, custom desktop applications, and other device-to-server scenarios.

For example, if you have an Ad Marvel account, you can make server-to-server ad calls between Ad Marvel and OpenX. To set this up, contact your Ad Marvel account manager and provide them with your OpenX delivery domain and ad unit ID. AdMarvel will then set up the server-to-server integration and incorporate OpenX report data in your AdMarvel reports. For details, see AdMarvel demand partners.

To help solve special integration issues, OpenX supports various types server-to-server implementations through ad requests.

Important: Proxied ad requests do not comply with some IAB specifications. Work with your OpenX account manager to ensure a complete and proper integration via server-to-server ad calls.

To ensure that ad serving features (such as frequency capping and targeting) work properly, follow these guidelines when making server-to-server ad calls:

* User IDs. If you are using typical web ad requests, OpenX uses the ```OX_u``` cookie, which contains a unique user ID. Ideally, you proxy this cookie from the client to the Ad Server. This requires:

Extraction of the Set-Cookie header that OpenX sends to pass the cookie to the client
Retrieval of the cookie sent by the client to your servers
Forwarding the cookie to OpenX Ad Server
Alternatively, you can use the xid parameter.

HTTP headers. OpenX uses the following HTTP headers, which should be forwarded from the client or set up to reflect realistic values in your server:
* Accept-Language
* Host
* Referer
* User-Agent
* X-Forwarded-For

Important: The User-Agent header is critical for validating requests against known spiders and bots. You must forward the exact client user agent string or ensure that any custom user agent is pre-pended with "Mozilla Compatible".

Query arguments. In addition to required ad request parameters, we suggest you provide additional information in your server-to-server ad requests. For example, the tz (timezone) parameter is recommended.

## Structured response

If you need to manipulate a structured response to render ads in a custom application, you can implement an ad request to OpenX that has a corresponding structure. For example, you might create an ad request to display ads on a mobile device or a desktop application. Your application must be able to parse the response and then serve the selected ads. OpenX provides structured responses in XML, JSON, and JSONP.

You can make the following types of requests for a structured response:

* Standalone. Requests an ad for a single ad unit.
* Ad unit group. Requests ads for multiple ad units in a single call, referenced by an ad unit group ID. This type of request is required for companion ad placement.
* Multi-ad unit. Requests ads for multiple ad units in a single call.

You can also request a delivery response for one or more ad units and one or more ad unit groups in a single call to OpenX Ad Server.
When a user interacts with your custom application, which has been designed to communicate with OpenX:

* The custom application invokes an ad request for the ad unit, ad unit group, or multiple ad units.
* The Ad Server receives the request, performs ad selection, and returns a structured delivery response.
* The custom application parses the response and renders the selected ad in the appropriate location.

To configure your custom application:

* Create ad units or ad unit groups in the OpenX UI or via the OpenX API.
* Implement the appropriate logic and configuration in your custom application to generate OpenX ad requests based on corresponding examples provided in this ad requests section.
* Configure your custom application with the appropriate ad unit or ad unit group IDs.
* Implement the appropriate logic in your application to parse the structured response from OpenX, and then render the ads to the end user.

Note: These ad requests use a client-side impression counting mechanism. Your custom application should be configured to handle this operation. Work with your OpenX account manager to ensure a complete and proper integration.

### Standalone ad requests

The following example shows an ad request for an XML response, which will fulfill a single ad unit.

Standalone request XML ad request
```
http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/arx?auid=6
```
The following example shows a request for a standalone JSON response, which will fulfill a single ad unit.

Standalone request JSON ad request
```
http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/arj?auid=6
```
The following example shows a request for a standalone JSONP response, which will fulfill a single ad unit.

Standalone request JSONP ad request
```
http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/arj?auid=6&callback=foo
```
Where:
* ```http``` is the protocol. If your ad space uses SSL/TLS, use https instead.
* ```delivery_server_domain```. The hostname of your OpenX delivery server
* ```/w```. Indicates the web delivery medium
* ```/1.0```. Indicates version 1.0 of the OpenX Supply API
* ```/arx``` or ```/arj```. Indicates a request to serve structured XML delivery response (/arx) or a JSON delivery response (/arj)
* ```?```. Separates the ad request from the ad request parameters
* ```auid```. The ad unit ID
* ```&```. Separates each parameter
* ```callback```. Indicates the JavaScript function wrapper to return in the JSONP response

### Ad unit group ad requests

Request ads for multiple ad units in a single call, referenced by an ad unit group ID.

XML ad unit group request

The following request for an XML response will fulfill multiple ad units.
```
http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/arx?pgid=123
```
JSON ad unit group request

The following request for an ad unit group will fulfill multiple ad units.
```
http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/arj?pgid=123
```
JSONP ad unit group request

The following request for an ad unit group will fulfill multiple ad units.
```
http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/arj?pgid=123&callback=foo
```
Where:

* ```http``` is the protocol. If your ad space uses SSL/TLS, use https instead.
* ```delivery_server_domain``` is the hostname of your OpenX delivery server.
* ```/w``` indicates to the OpenX servers that this is the web delivery medium.
* ```/1.0``` indicates that OpenX should use version 1.0 of the OpenX XML or JSON protocol.
* ```/arx``` or ```/arj```. Indicates a request to return a structured XML or JSON delivery response
* ```?.``` Separates the ad request from its ad request parameters
* ```pgid```. The ID of the ad unit group
* ```&```. Separates parameters in the ad request
* ```callback```. Indicates the JavaScript function wrapper to return in the JSONP response

### Multi-ad unit requests

The following request will fulfill multiple ad units.
```
http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/arx?auid=1,2,3
```
JSON multi-ad unit request JSON ad request

The following request will fulfill multiple ad units.
```
http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/arj?auid=1,2,3
```
Sample multi-ad unit request JSONP ad request

The following request will fulfill multiple ad units.
```
http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/arj?auid=1,2,3&callback=foo
```
Where:

* ```http```. Indicates the protocol. If your ad space uses SSL/TLS, use https instead.
* ```delivery_server_domain```. The domain of your OpenX delivery server
* ```/w```. Indicates to the OpenX servers that this is the web delivery medium.
* ```/1.0```. Indicates version 1.0 of the OpenX XML or JSON protocol
* ```/arx``` or ```/arj```. Indicates the action to perform (in this case a request to return a structured XML or JSON delivery response)
* ```?```. Separates the ad request from its ad request parameters.
* ```auid```. The ad unit ID
* ```&```. Separates parameters in the ad request
* ```callback```. Indicates the JavaScript function wrapper to return in the JSONP response

Combination request for ad units and ad unit groups in an XML ad request

You can also combine auids and pgids in a single ad request. The following request for multiple ad units and an ad unit group will fulfill multiple ad units in a single request.
```
http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/arx?auid=1,2,3&pgid=123
```

### Structured response

When OpenX receives an ad request for a structured response, it returns one of the supported response formats, which your custom application can interpret and render appropriately. It is a good idea to test a few ad requests to see what the response looks like. This way, you can review how OpenX represents its objects in its response, and make sure that your custom application configuration is able to handle the response.

In the case of a request for a JSONP response, when OpenX receives the ad request, it returns the JSON structure, wrapped in the JavaScript function, which was set in the ad request's callback parameter. The response from OpenX is a call to the specified JavaScript function, using the JSON structure as its input.

All structured responses contain the following elements for managing refresh:

* refresh_delay - represents the number of seconds to wait between ad reloads
* refresh_max - represents the maximum number of times to reload a new ad

To use these fields, your client application must:

* Identify the refresh_delay and refresh_max fields in the XML or JSON response.
* Append rc=COUNT where COUNT is replaced with the iteration of the reload (e.g., first refresh has rc=1 and third has rc=3).
For example:
```
max = response.refresh_max
delay = response.refresh_delay
for (i=1;i++;i<=refresh_max) {
  sleep(delay)
  url = build_url() + "&rc=" + i
  fetch_ad(url)
}
```
## Video ad requests
To serve a video ad to your ad space:
1. Use the OpenX UI to create the following types of video ad units: Linear. Full-page interstitial video ads that display during video content in a video player as in-read or in-feed ad units.
2. Retrieve the ad request URL for a single ad unit (a standalone ad request). Alternatively, you can include an ad unit group, which requests companion ad placement for multiple ad units (referenced by the pgid parameter) in a single call; or, a multi-ad unit that requests ads for multiple ad units in a single call.
3. (Optional) Set various ad request parameters in your video ad request URL.
4. Configure your VAST-compliant video player to send the ad request URL to OpenX and receive its VAST 2.0 XML response.
5. Implement the video ad requests in your ad space.
6. When a user visits the ad space, the video player invokes an ad request for the ad unit referenced in the video ad request.
7. OpenX receives the video ad request, performs ad selection, and returns a VAST 2.0-compliant XML response, which your VAST 2.0-compliant video player can interpret and render in the appropriate location.
8. The video player renders the selected ad in the appropriate location. To count video impressions, configure your video player to perform client-side counting.

Tip: For mobile apps, OpenX provides a mobile SDK for Android and iOS, which includes a VAST-compatible player and various integration scenarios.

### Standalone video ad request example

Video ad requests typically contain an ad request URL and various parameters.

```http://delivery_server_domain/v/1.0/av?auid=543776&cs=xyz&c.gender=m```

Where:

* http (or https) is the protocol.
* delivery_server_domain is the hostname of your OpenX delivery server.
* /v indicates the video delivery medium.
* /1.0 indicates version 1.0 of the OpenX video protocol.
* /av indicates the video ad request.
* ? separates the ad request from the following ad request parameters: auid - The unique ID of the ad unit. For a multi-ad unit request, use a comma-separated list (e.g., auid=1,5,7). For an ad unit group request, use the pgid parameter instead (e.g., pgid=5).
* &. separates the first ad request parameter from subsequent parameters.
* cs. Client state, indicates a unique ID used to communicate between the click URL and the ad.
* c.gender. a custom variable for the user's gender.

This request returns a response similar to the following example:
```
